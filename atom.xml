    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Xinhua Finance, Shanghai, April 10 (Reporter Yang Youzong) The reporter saw in the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Pudong New District, Shanghai a few days ago that many container trucks were parked end to end on both sides of the road. These truck drivers can be as short as three to five days, or as long as they have no work to do for a week or two. Due to the control of the epidemic, it was difficult for some truck drivers to leave Shanghai, and the business volume shrank.</p></blockquote><p>The stranded truck drivers are a microcosm of the logistics obstruction caused by the epidemic. Since the current round of the epidemic, prevention and control measures have been upgraded in many places, and the travel of residents and the flow of goods have been affected to some extent. According to industry analysis, normalized prevention and control policies will increase the cost pressure of logistics enterprises, and will also make logistics industry practitioners face greater uncertainty.</p><p>The logistics system of truck drivers stranded is affected</p><p>In the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Pudong New District, Shanghai, the reporter saw trucks with Shanghai E, Shanghai F and Su E license plates parked on the side of the road on Gangjian Road, Shendong Road and other roads. Go to bed, or make phone calls anxiously.</p><p>The driver Guo Liutao, a native of Shenqiu County, Zhoukou City, Henan Province, is 32 years old this year. He has been working as a truck driver for two years, and usually runs the Yangtze River Delta route. “I stopped in Shanghai on April 3, and it has been 4 days now. I have food and lodging in the car. I haven’t worked for 4 days. It turned out to be more than 200 yuan for one trip a day. Now I can’t make any money. The boss doesn’t make any money either.”</p><p>Shanghai has one of the busiest ports in the world. Data show that in 2021, the container throughput of Shanghai Port will exceed 47 million TEUs, ranking first in the world for 12 consecutive years. Shanghai Port Group announced on April 2 that according to internal data monitoring, the current operation of Shanghai Port is stable and orderly, and the berthing efficiency of Shanghai Port is significantly better than the overall level in 2021. Since March 28, the average waiting time of container ships in Shanghai Port has been less than 24 hours, and the average waiting time has been less than 10 ships. SIPG emphasized that the production and operation of the terminal are normal, and there is no congestion of container ships.</p><p>Although terminal operations have not been affected, the reporter learned that under the epidemic prevention and control, the container transshipment system has been greatly affected, and inter-provincial transportation has been greatly affected.</p><p>Liu Min, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce, said, “Shanghai is indeed facing some difficulties in ensuring the supply of living materials, such as the lack of smooth inter-provincial logistics due to the impact of the epidemic, and the lack of terminal capacity resulting in delayed delivery. We are working hard to get through with the support of all parties. Blocking points, solving difficulties, and trying to ensure the basic living needs of citizens during the epidemic.”</p><p><img src="/2022/04/11/The-epidemic-has-repeatedly-blocked-logistics-How-much-is-the-cost-of-logistics-enterprises/1.jpeg"><br>(The epidemic prevention seal on the collection card taken on April 7. Photo by Xinhua Finance reporter Yang Youzong)</p><p>On a Shanghai D license plate collection card in the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Shanghai, the reporter saw that a seal was pasted next to the driver’s cab, and the seal was signed as “Nantong Tongzhou District Traffic Port Prevention and Control Team”.</p><p>A driver said that many places are now unable to get off the high-speed, and the pass does not work, and some places do not recognize it . “Some drivers will not let them go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and can only pull the goods back.”</p><p>The driver, Zhang Chaohua, said that on April 1, he drove a pickup truck to a certain place in Jiangsu, where he queued from 7 am to 12 pm, but was told before getting off the expressway that the Shanghai license plate could not get off the expressway, so he had to go back the same way. .</p><p>Strict policies are behind the continuous tightening of epidemic prevention and control policies. On April 5 and April 6, Ningbo, Zhejiang reported 8 cases of infections related to road freight, including truck drivers, long-distance freight drivers, and gas station staff in high-speed service areas. After tracing the source of the flow, the trajectories of the cases focus on high-speed exits and high-speed service areas, especially restaurants, shower rooms, toilets, gas stations and other places in the high-speed service areas.</p><h2 id="The-cost-pressure-of-logistics-enterprises-will-increase"><a href="#The-cost-pressure-of-logistics-enterprises-will-increase" class="headerlink" title="The cost pressure of logistics enterprises will increase"></a>The cost pressure of logistics enterprises will increase</h2><p>The repeated outbreak of the epidemic will have a greater impact on the express logistics industry. Beginning in early March this year, affected by the epidemic in many parts of the country, some transit centers and outlets were closed, and express delivery in many places was interrupted in stages. Some e-commerce platforms also experienced delivery delays and suspensions.</p><p>According to a research report released by Sinolink Securities on April 5, the epidemic is expected to have a greater impact on express delivery services, and the volume of express delivery business is expected to decline.</p><p>Data from the State Post Bureau shows that the volume of express delivery business in March is expected to drop by 2.5% year-on-year, and the revenue of express delivery business is expected to drop by 4.4% year-on-year. The industry entered the off-season in March, and the price side remained stable.</p><p>The impact of the epidemic may disrupt the growth pace of the express delivery business in the early stage. Prior to this, the performance of many express delivery companies has entered the cashing period.</p><p>The main operating data released by YTO from January to February 2022 shows that its express delivery business completed 2.297 billion tickets, a year-on-year increase of 27.81%; the operating income was about 7.624 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 39.28%; the net profit attributable to the parent was about 545 million yuan. , a year-on-year increase of 186.36%.</p><p>According to the annual report of SF Holding, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the profit was 2.471 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 43.01%, and the non-net profit after deduction was 1.501 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.07%.</p><p>Guosen Securities analyst Jiang Ming said that it is estimated that in the past two to three weeks, the epidemic has caused the business volume of the express delivery industry to decrease by 10% to 20% compared with usual. At the same time, considering the impact of the reduced business volume on the allocation of fixed costs, it is expected that the short-term profits of express companies will be affected by The negative impact outweighs the business volume. However, the impact of the epidemic is one-off, and the short-term express demand is more suppressed rather than disappeared. Therefore, it believes that after the epidemic resumes, express demand is expected to rebound. “Considering that the profits of leading express delivery companies will be greatly restored this year, the current valuation is relatively cheap, and we continue to recommend leading express delivery companies.”</p><h2 id="The-global-logistics-supply-chain-continues-to-be-impacted"><a href="#The-global-logistics-supply-chain-continues-to-be-impacted" class="headerlink" title="The global logistics supply chain continues to be impacted"></a>The global logistics supply chain continues to be impacted</h2><p>The poor transportation of containers has affected the production and circulation of some enterprises. A person in charge of a company in Pudong said that the current circulation system is not smooth, and even if the company produces products, it is not easy to ship out, so the downtime is simply extended.</p><p>Wang Hai, editor-in-chief of the shipping industry network and an analyst in the shipping industry, said that although terminal operations have not been affected, the closure and control measures will have a certain impact on truck transportation and container turnover, which may lead to some container companies to take corresponding adjustment measures.</p><p><img src="/2022/04/11/The-epidemic-has-repeatedly-blocked-logistics-How-much-is-the-cost-of-logistics-enterprises/2.jpeg"><br>(A pickup truck parked in the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Pudong New District, Shanghai on April 7. Photo by Xinhua Finance reporter Yang Youzong)</p><p>Maersk, a container shipping company, stated on its official website that at present, Shanghai ports such as Yangshan Port and Waigaoqiao Port are still operating normally, but the warehouses in the closed area have been seriously affected, and the efficiency of Maersk’s freight services to and from Shanghai will also be further affected. Maersk said it will provide multimodal transport services by barge and rail as an alternative to transport between Shanghai and nearby cities.</p><p>Wang Ling, an analyst at East Asia Qianhai Securities, said that the lack of shipping capacity in the container industry has pushed up freight rates. In 2021, under the influence of multiple factors such as repeated COVID-19 epidemics, increased transportation demand, and limited supply of transportation capacity, the global logistics supply chain will continue to be challenged and impacted by complex situations such as port congestion, container shortages, and inland transportation delays, and the supply and demand relationship of container transportation will continue to be tense. . The container and dry bulk cargo industry already has the advantage of scale under the tight transportation capacity, and the leading enterprises in the global route are expected to benefit.</p><p>The epidemic has brought a new shock to the gradually recovering economy, and the impact may extend throughout the first half of the year, as demand recovery and expected improvement will take time. Sheng Songcheng, executive vice president of the CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance, wrote in an article that as the epidemic is repeated in China’s core cities , the spillover effect of the epidemic will be more obvious. We should pay close attention to weak links in the economy, stabilize employment, protect people’s livelihood, and promote consumption. Continue to rationally relax real estate regulation from the demand side. Take infrastructure investment as an important starting point for stabilizing growth. Fiscal policy should be more proactive. Monetary policy should now pay more attention to the use of quantitative tools.</p><p>“In fixed asset investment, infrastructure investment is more controllable, which can promote economic stabilization and improve market expectations in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, infrastructure investment is still an important starting point for stable growth this year, and under the impact of the epidemic, Infrastructure investment will play a more important role.” Sheng Songcheng said.</p><p>Statement: Xinhua Finance is a national financial information platform constructed by Xinhua News Agency.

There were no moving cars on the road, nor could he hear any traffic or whistles. Every time he took a step, he could hear the rubbing of slippers and pebbles on the ground.

Source: Respondents</p><p>The stove was remodeled from a paint bucket, and a large square was cut at the bottom. In order to make the pot stand and keep it stable, the mouth of the bucket was shaped like a petal. After several days of use, the interior of this remodeled stove has been smoked black, and the white paint stains on the outside have turned yellow.</p><p>The 39-year-old Master Wei is from Jining, Shandong Province.

This truck is full of more than 30 tons of potatoes.</p><p>On March 29, after learning about the closure of the vegetable market, Master Wei and his party were arranged to be in a warehouse rented by Boss Xia. This warehouse is located in Minhang District, Shanghai, next to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport. It is an Audi warehouse. The restaurants, supermarkets, and shops here have all closed, and you can only rely on yourself to eat and drink.</p><p>On the afternoon of April 7, Master Wei and his party stopped at a warehouse in Minhang District, waiting for the last truck of potatoes to be unloaded. Source: Respondents</p><p>In the first two days of arriving in Shanghai, Master Wei and his party still had some stored food, but the three adult men had three meals a day, and they ate them in three or four days. On April 3, Boss Xia entrusted two handfuls of noodles, oil and salt to be delivered. At that time, they had already eaten up their own stored food, so they began to eat this batch of potatoes shipped from Shandong, which was boiled without oil. Eat, you can fry and eat when there is oil.</p><p>On the afternoon of April 7, on the 10th day of being trapped in Shanghai, Mr. Wei’s potatoes in his car were all sold out, and there were still a whole carload of potatoes in the car of his friends, some of which were about to sprout. On the night of the 11th day of being trapped, nearly 100 tons of potatoes were sold out in three trucks.</p><p>“It didn’t work in the first few days. There were only a few boxes of goods a day, and it didn’t even move for a few days. It was better when it arrived on the sixth or seventh day. It was more than 100 boxes for a pull.” Master Wei said.</p><p>In the early morning of the 12th day of being trapped, Boss Xia withdrew from the warehouse, and they drove to the road more than 20 kilometers away from the warehouse, waiting for the lockdown to be lifted. Boss Xia, who never showed up, left two boxes of potatoes for Master Wei and the others, about 100 pounds in total, and some noodles.</p><p>“There aren’t many noodles, so we’ll eat it sparingly.” Now the three eat twice a day, the first at around 10 am and the second at around 3 pm. Judging from the current food, Master Wei estimates that it is about It can last six or seven days.</p><p>There are more than three people trapped in this Audi warehouse at the same time as Master Wei. Master Wei introduced that Boss Xia is from Anhui, and Boss Xia’s fellow villagers also pulled two trucks of goods and entered Shanghai at this special point, but they started from Hefei. During the waiting period, the number of drivers stranded here changed from 3 to 5, but we didn’t communicate much, just chatting occasionally.</p><p>In fact, Master Wei and other truck drivers have tried various channels to apply for a pass. <font color=red>“A friend who can apply for a pass in the circle of friends is just joking, and no one can get a pass for Shanghai. “</font></p><p>“My wife is on the phone with me every day, and it’s useless to worry.” When asking questions about family members, Master Wei’s speech rate will slow down. There are 6 people in Master Wei’s family. He is the pillar of the family and the main source of income for the whole family.</p><p>“We don’t know when we can go back.” Master Wei told us when contacted again on the evening of the 9th.</p><p><font color=red>On the afternoon of April 8, we called Boss Xia to learn more about the situation. He told us that he has been taken to the makeshift hospital, and it is inconvenient to disclose other things. </font>Master Wei told us that after eating potatoes for two or three days, Boss Xia was quarantined - Master Wei had already started counting the days when he went home with potatoes.</p><p>A Fantastic Drift of an Auto Parts Sample<br>About ten kilometers away from Master Wei, Liu Ronghui (pseudonym), who is located in Shanghai Pudong New Area, is isolated at home. This is the 17th day of his detention, and it is unknown how many days he is working from home.</p><p>“As a dead fat house, I didn’t lose weight by exercising every day. This time, I kept it at home, giving non-staple food to the elderly and children, and giving snacks to my wife. I went out to volunteer from time to time to help, and I lost 8 pounds…”</p><p>Where can I buy in groups, and where can I grab food? How to stabilize my daughter when her homework is decreasing day by day? How to answer the customer’s urging, how to online, as much as possible to ensure the supply? For nearly a month, these three questions have plagued him alternately.</p><p><font color=red>“I have used all my papering skills in my life, but I am still riddled with holes.” </font> Liu Ronghui told us. (Note: The paper craftsman was originally a paper-paper worker. Li Hongzhang also mocked himself as a paper-paper craftsman. Later, this statement was gradually extended in East China. There were beautification and patchwork, but there was no way to solve the core problem. mean.)</p><p>After 1985, Liu Ronghui worked for a well-known parts manufacturer in Shanghai, with customers all over the world. “Basically all mainstream car companies use my parts.” Liu Ronghui said.</p><p>On March 14, Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province issued a notice to initiate a Level I emergency response. From now on, the city will completely suspend work, business, school, public places, and crowd gathering activities. At the same time, strict transportation control measures will be adopted throughout the city.</p><p>In this case, the companies involved in the region will stop production, and the inter-provincial logistics and express delivery will also stop. However, the new project samples in charge of Liu Ronghui need to be assembled and sent from the factory in Pinghu.</p><p>Pinghu City is a county-level city hosted by Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, next to Shanghai, where many world-renowned multinational companies, global industry leaders, chain-owner companies and benchmarking companies gather here. Automobiles, high-end machine tools and new materials are the advantages here. industry.</p><p>According to the “China Economic Times” report: Pinghu City leverages the strong chain extension of the automobile industry with “chain master” enterprises. There are 272 auto parts companies, including 8 of the top 100 global auto parts companies such as ABB in Switzerland, GKN in the United Kingdom, and Lear in the United States. They have formed a complete industrial chain supporting capability of “production of the whole car in Pinghu”, and are associated with auto parts every year. The production capacity is more than 5 million units. At present, Great Wall Motors has more than 50 supporting enterprises in Pinghu. <font color=red> It is reported that Pinghu has become one of the largest new energy drive motor production bases in the country. The total output value of the automobile industry chain is expected to exceed 50 billion yuan within two years, and will reach a scale of 100 billion yuan in five years.</font></p><p>“The car is not allowed to go directly to Shanghai.” Because the sealed samples cannot be sent directly to customers in other regions, and the trucks that customers collect goods cannot pick up the goods, Liu Ronghui’s “paper pasting” skills have been inspired.</p><p>“First, I found a way to find a customer with a temporary correspondence certificate, took the samples out of the urban area, and sent a special car to the customer after thinking of the transit warehouse in Jiaxing City. I didn’t expect the logistics company there to say that it would not accept the order to Shanghai. The reason is very It’s simple, the return trip from Shanghai will require 14-day quarantine.” <font color=red>Faced with this situation, Liu Ronghui could only arrange a special logistics vehicle to the brother factory in Changzhou, Jiangsu, and then let other customers’ logistics vehicles that have not left Pinghu take the samples away. Completely bypasses Shanghai.</font></p><p>On the evening of March 18, the samples finally arrived in Changzhou. But what made Liu Ronghui feel devastated was that a notice was issued on the same day, saying that 19 daily states would also have 3 days of closure and control management and nucleic acid of all staff.</p><p>“The mood at that time was like a refugee who escaped from Hiroshima to Nagasaki in 1945.” Liu Ronghui said.</p><p>Fortunately, the samples finally arrived in the hands of the customer. After seeing the news of the closure and control, major OEMs rushed to Changzhou before 24:00 on the 18th, towed away all the finished product inventory that could be towed away by the supplier, and took samples along the way. .</p><p>“The industrial belt is going crazy. The Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are the main suppliers. The mainland of Changchun is an ecu supplier. Changchun has been closed for almost a month. It’s gone.” Liu Ronghui said.</p><p>Companies such as Tesla and Weilai have been affected.</p><p>On March 28, according to Reuters , Tesla plans to suspend the production activities of its super factory in Shanghai from March 28 for 4 days due to the impact of Shanghai’s epidemic prevention policy. Bloomberg also previously reported that Tesla’s Shanghai plant will stop production for at least one day starting on Monday (March 28).</p><p>On April 8, Guotai Junan Futures wrote in a research report: Affected by the epidemic, the production of 550,000 tons of polyester bottle flakes in East China has recently been reduced to around 70%. Affected by the epidemic and logistics, some major polyester industrial yarn factories have reduced their production load or even stopped production this week, such as Yufu, Jinhuite and Wenlong have stopped production, and the load of Sunway and Sunfull has increased slightly. July 7), the overall theoretical start-up load of domestic polyester industrial yarn dropped to about 63%. In addition, Hilead’s current operating load is temporarily maintained, but the Haining area is controlled by the epidemic and cannot enter or leave the logistics. If there are not enough raw and auxiliary materials for Hilead and the logistics has not resumed, production must be reduced and stopped.</p><p>On April 9, NIO issued a “Note on Recent Production and Delivery”. NIO said that since March, due to the epidemic, the company’s supply chain partners in Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu and other places have successively stopped production. It has not been restored yet. Affected by this, Weilai’s vehicle production has been suspended.</p><p>Weilai said that the delivery of many users’ vehicles will be delayed in the near future. “I also ask for your understanding. The company will work with supply chain partners to resume production as soon as possible and deliver vehicles to everyone as soon as possible on the premise of meeting the requirements of epidemic prevention.”</p><p>Drivers become in short supply “materials”<br>As long as it can be delivered, regardless of the cost and transportation needs that do not consider the timeliness, logistics companies are also “papering”.</p><p>On April 3, Gaopeng received a notice in the tenant communication group in the park. The notice reads: According to the spirit of the “Kunshan Epidemic Prevention and Control Announcement No. 24 in 2022”, each company will take a silent break from April 3 to April 6, and employees of the company will return to their place of residence to participate in regional nucleic acid testing.</p><p>Gao Peng is the head of Huayuan World Logistics. The company is located in German Industrial Park, Zhangpu Town, Kunshan. Many precision machinery companies have settled in this park, such as Eisenmann China Automobile Assembly Line Production Base, Berger Precision Machinery Parts (Kunshan) Co., Ltd.; Jiangsu Changjiang Water Pump Co., Ltd.; and many logistics companies, such as DHL (Sinotrans) DHL).</p><p>It is understood that Kunshan is a major production center for PCB, electronic foundry, panels, and notebook computer components. Nandian, Xinxing, AUO, Visionox, Longteng Optoelectronics, Shishuo, Compal, and Luxshare have factories in the area. . The main customers of Huayuan Tianxia Logistics are mostly electronic components, packaging consumables and mold products from nearby factories.</p><p>“It hasn’t stopped since the New Year.” After seeing the notice, Gao Peng complained inwardly. But Tucao returned to Tucao, and the movements in his hands did not stop. Before the silence time came, Gao Peng and the others packed up the things that should be packed, and some colleagues who had come from Suzhou went back to Suzhou. It is understood that Huayuan World Logistics has two offices, one in Suzhou and the other in Kunshan.</p><p>“Not long after the New Year, there was an epidemic in Suzhou. After Suzhou, Shanghai came out, and then there were sporadic epidemics in Hangzhou and Zhejiang, which have always been around us.” Gao Peng concluded with a wry smile.</p><p>Master Gao is one of the hired drivers of Huayuan World Logistics. Unlike Master Wei, he is not personally affiliated. He is currently isolated at home and can still get the basic salary from the company.</p><p>On March 9, Master Gao received a notice from the community and asked him to isolate at home because he went to Shanghai once at the end of February and has never been to Shanghai since. Now, this is the second time he has been quarantined because of the epidemic in Kunshan itself, and the quarantine period starts on April 1.</p><p>“Since the outbreak of the epidemic, I have been in quarantine almost all the time, and I haven’t run much in the past two months. A colleague ran for a few days last month and has been in isolation.” Master Gao also told us that the company’s Kunshan side There are also seven or eight drivers, all of whom are in home quarantine.</p><p>A suitable driver has become a shortage of “materials”.</p><p>“For example, when you go to Henan, as long as you enter Henan, the green code will turn yellow (code). Henan is right in the middle of China, and many people who travel from south to north have to pass through Henan.” Gao Peng told us that after the epidemic in Shanghai became serious, Corresponding strict control measures have been issued in many places. These measures have become a sieve, and there are not many drivers who can stay.</p><p>In order to ensure the smooth passage of living materials, the green pass issued by Henan Province. Source: Respondents</p><p>Gao Peng told “Chinese Entrepreneurs” that many older drivers have a junior high school degree, or even less than a junior high school degree. It is very difficult to get a driver’s license. How to smoothly switch and use the health codes of various cities when crossing provinces and cities is a “threshold”.</p><p>“For example, from Nanjing to Suzhou, Suzhou has the code of Suzhou, and Nanjing has the code of Nanjing. They may not be able to get it when they are old, but this must be done by themselves.” Gao Peng explained, “The isolation of isolation, the yellow code I can’t run, and it will take several days to change back for the next job, and those who don’t know how to use these health codes, the transport vehicles are seriously insufficient now.”</p><p>In late March, Master Gao, who had just been released from the first quarantine, went out to deliver goods.</p><p>“At that time, the local area in Kunshan required a blue label, a green label, and an orange label. I set up a blue label and planned to go from Kunshan to Suzhou on the high-speed.” The color label in Master Gao’s mouth is similar to the “truck version” of the health code.</p><p>It is understood that on March 25, Kunshan City implemented the “Classification Management System for Trucks by Risk Level”, and applied “orange, blue and green” classification management signs for trucks based on the health information of truck drivers and passengers, and based on the “orange, blue, green” classification management system “Three-color signs for precise prevention and control.</p><p>Blue indicates that there is a history of passing through low-risk areas outside Kunshan City, and the itinerary card does not have an asterisk.</p><p>Recently, Mr. Gao got his salary for March, a total of more than 5,000 yuan. What is different from the past is that the income structure has changed from basic salary plus commission to basic salary plus subsidy.</p><p>“To be honest, it’s not a lot, because it’s a total of four or five days of class.” Master Gao said.</p><p>It is understood that in the logistics industry, many drivers who run long-distance trunk lines are paid by trip. For example, if you specially run from Beijing to Guangzhou, it will take four or five days for a round trip, and the intermediate loading and unloading will stay for one day. You can run three or four times a month, and the commission is the main source of income.</p><p>Gao Peng reluctantly said: “It may be a month, two months of hard support, and only three months to pay the basic salary. Large companies may be fine, but small and micro enterprises like us basically can’t stand it all the time. “</p><p>Source: People’s Vision</p><p>On the evening of April 7, Kunshan issued the No. 37 Circular on Epidemic Prevention and Control, and decided to extend the silence period for 4 days from 24:00 on April 8 to 24:00 on April 12, 2022.</p><p>On April 8, AUO, a major panel manufacturer, issued an announcement stating that its Kunshan subsidiary will suspend work from April 8 to 12 in cooperation with the local government’s epidemic prevention and control policy. During the shutdown period, inventory will be allocated to reduce the impact on customers.</p><p>Guanghua-KY, a car interior parts factory, pointed out that its subsidiary Xiangyang Guangjia has flexibly adjusted its production plan due to the suspension of production due to the tightening of epidemic control and logistics blockades in Shanghai, Wuxi and Kunshan for its main customers. At present, sufficient raw material inventory has been prepared to meet the production needs of customers after resumption of work.</p><p>According to the Aijiwei APP, other Taiwanese factories that have announced the suspension of the Kunshan subsidiary include AUO, Xinxing, Baicheng, Lantian, Huafu, Anli-KY, Shanghua, etc.</p><p>Compared with the material problems that can be perceived immediately, the B-side supply chain hiding behind the daily consumption of the public cannot be perceived at the first time.</p><p>“Adding all kinds of time costs, the transportation cost will definitely be high. As far as I know, these companies will lose a part of the money if they send a truck of goods, and the freight will increase by nearly four or five times.” Gao Peng told us.</p><p>wait for a rebound<br>For companies, transportation costs increase and production capacity is limited; for drivers, income decreases.</p><p>“The congestion started around 12 o’clock, and there are still about 3 kilometers to reach the toll station. It is estimated that it will be blocked until 6:00 in the evening to get off the expressway.” On April 8, we got in touch with Master Deng. Among the drivers, and among the acquaintances and colleagues around the driver, the only one still running on the road.</p><p>Master Deng mainly runs short and medium distances, mainly in Jiangsu. There are two main routes for frequent runs, Changzhou to Suqian and Changzhou to Xuzhou. He used to be an accountant in a factory mainly engaged in frozen chicken and duck agricultural products. Five or six years ago, the owner of the factory proposed to let him buy a car and help him pick up the goods. Master Deng started his career as a driver.</p><p>At 6:00 in the morning of April 7th, Master Deng set out from Changzhou and arrived in Suqian at 4:00 in the afternoon. After loading the goods, he went back from Suqian. He slept in the service area at night. If it is not blocked, he should be home soon when we contact him. .</p><p>In the mouth of truck drivers, roads are divided into “on the road” and “off the road.” The upper road is the expressway, and the lower road includes various national roads, provincial roads, and rural roads. Spanning hundreds of thousands of kilometers, except for large-scale logistics, few drivers will take high-speed all the way. Under the epidemic, in order to reduce the time stuck on the road, most of the drivers chose the high speed.</p><p>“If you go down the road, there are checkpoints in every region and every county, and they are all checked. The congestion will be even worse, and you may not be able to get there for a few days. Only the exit of the expressway is blocked, and the others are unblocked.” Master Deng told us.</p><p>Master Deng calculated an account for us: before the epidemic, it was about 4,000 yuan per order, and now it has increased by almost a few hundred, but it cannot reach the previous profit. Although the driver can get an extra subsidy of 500 yuan, it may cost 1,000 yuan to go on the highway. After all, the driver still earns 500 yuan less, and there are always traffic jams. The original cost, including fuel fees and high-speed charges, was about 2,000 yuan per trip, but now it’s about 3,000 yuan.</p><p>This means that the price of a single trip has increased, but the profit and one-month income have fallen.</p><p>“The outbreak of the epidemic in Shanghai was almost 10 times a month, but now it can only run about six or seven times. In the past month, the loss is nearly 10,000 yuan. It used to be about 20,000 yuan a month, but now I earn 10,000 yuan. Money is difficult.” Master Deng said.</p><p>In addition to fewer trips and profits for drivers, the company is also cutting production.</p><p>“Compared with the original, the company’s sales volume has decreased by about 30%. We are refrigerated, the shelf life is 12 months, and it is not affected by the weather very much. However, if it cannot be sold, the storage cost will increase, so we can only reduce production.” Master Deng, an accountant, keenly captured this change.</p><p>It’s not just Mr. Deng’s company that has increased costs.</p><p>“Recently, the Shanghai port is in a state of semi-paralysis. If the ship is not chartered, the freighter will jump to the port. If Shanghai is closed for two weeks, the freighter will first go to Fukuoka, Busan, and return after a month. The bulk parts are basically only safe stocks. Some small-volume materials can still be transshipped by the China-Europe Railway, and large-volume railway transportation costs are not worth the goods, so it is better to stop production.” Liu Ronghui told us that now OEMs are mainly eating inventory, and now physical goods and inventory are king. era.</p><p>Zheng Cuntuan of China-Europe Qatar Airways told us: China-Europe Qatar Airways has been operating normally, and its sources of goods are mainly from Fujian, Guangdong. And the company’s business has grown significantly. It’s hard to tell where the current growth is coming from, though, and it will take two months to know. Because many customers are in urgent need to go to China-Europe Qatar Airways, the planned cargo (after six months) will go slowly by sea.</p><p>As long as demand is there, the impact may be short-lived, and a rebound is just a matter of time.</p><p>“Maybe this period of time will have a serious impact on some small and micro enterprises, but in the long run, if you give some economic stimulus, you should be able to survive. In 2020, we will also send epidemic prevention materials to Wuhan. The first half of the year is very difficult. Difficulties, the manufacturing and logistics industries in the second half of the year are soaring. “ Gao Peng said.</p><p>“I believe that the vitality of the enterprise will not have much impact.” Zheng Cuntuan said.</p><p>The stabilization and recovery of the supply chain has already begun.</p><p>According to reports, on April 7, the Ministry of Transport held a meeting on the logistics guarantee coordination working mechanism. The National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Health and Health Commission and other members of the mechanism attended the meeting.</p><p>The meeting emphasized that coordinating the work of epidemic prevention and control and logistics security is an important task to win the new round of epidemic prevention and control, and it is to ensure the safety and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain, and maintain the normal production and living order of the people. important foundation.</p><p>The meeting pointed out that the problems of inadequate implementation of policies in some regions and overweighting at various levels still exist, and the problem of poor logistics operation in some epidemic-related regions such as the Yangtze River Delta is more prominent. The operation is smooth and the service guarantee for truck drivers is strengthened.</p><p>On April 8, Xiao Yaqing, Minister of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that all efforts should be made to stabilize the production of enterprises and the smooth connection of the supply chain, strengthen the coordination of logistics, transportation and factor guarantees, open up blocking points, and ensure the smooth transportation of key materials and important products.</p><p>On the evening of April 9, Master Wei was still counting potatoes on the side of the road, waiting to go home. We wanted to help him find some supplies to send as much as possible, but Master Wei refused, “Don’t bother, it’s all sealed here, it’s hard to get it, so don’t cause trouble for everyone.”</p><blockquote><footer><strong>@中国企业家杂志</strong><cite><a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1729707066723417822&wfr=spider&for=pc">baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1729707066723417822&wfr=spider&for=pc</a></cite></footer></blockquote><blockquote><footer><strong>@GoogleTranslate</strong><cite><a href="https://baijiahao-baidu-com.translate.goog/s?id=1729707066723417822&wfr=spider&for=pc&_x_tr_sl=zh-CN&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">baijiahao-baidu-com.translate.goog/s?id=1729707066723417822&wfr=spider&for=pc&_x_tr_sl=zh-CN&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp</a></cite></footer></blockquote>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;Some truck drivers were trapped in Shanghai for delivering supplies, some were blocked on highways, and some were quarantined at home because they had just returned to a medium-high-risk place. They are only one link in the construction of the logistics economy - the huge logistics chain is undergoing an unprecedented major test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Wei was wearing blue slippers and walking in the middle of the road. There were no moving cars on the road, nor could he hear any traffic or whistles. Every time he took a step, he could hear the rubbing of slippers and pebbles on the ground. The crickets in the open space on the side are also very lively. If you listen carefully, you can even find a few frog calls from the sound of the crickets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>Finally the LB group announced the price increased yesterday after the global players with domestic 1000CNY/MT increase, and foreign market 150USD/MT increase, which fllowed by tens of manufactures in China till now.</p><p>In the last month of 2021, the market of tio2 suddenly sore with a new trend of increasing after several months silence.<br>2021 definitely is the most vibrant year of the last decade. But there are obvious reasons for the increases before as,</p><ul><li>The economic recovery boost the needs.</li><li>The pandemic reduces the outputs.</li><li>The global power crisis.</li><li>And the prolonged supply chain.</li></ul><p>But this time, the new trend in this month looks unfamiliar. The needs-supply background is not changed, but why do they increase? It is hard to find out why, but after talking with few experts in our channel, we conclued something in common.</p><p>When we asked, is there any shortage of the ilmenite? power? labor? or productive elements?</p><ul><li>No.</li></ul><p>Is there any policies which reduces the output? What is the quantity estimated to be influenced?</p><ul><li>Not yet but yes, will be. The government is expected to announce the production limits policy to grante the blue sky during winter olympics in northern China for 30-50days. The quantity is arround 100k-120k tons in total.</li></ul><p>Will the production limits policy break the balance of the supply-needs background?</p><ul><li>Not likely. Even there might be 100k-120k tons outputs will be cut, but the spring is always the off-season in tio2 market. Traditionally, the manufactures were likely to spend 15-20days for maintainance during spring.</li></ul><h2 id="Explain"><a href="#Explain" class="headerlink" title="Explain"></a>Explain</h2><p>So, why do they do it?</p><ul><li>To follow up with global trend, the international plays such as Kronos, Tronox, Venator, Chemours, and more announced their increase will effect on in Jan 1st. 2022. After Jan 1st, 2022, there will be more users shifting to China SP grades tio2. Last several monthes, the Western CP grades in western world was in shortate meanwhile the China SP grades price is catching up with the western CP in Asia pacific, africa and many other regions. The increasing price of China SP in some degree enlarge the needs of Western CP grades. But with the official increasing of the western CP grades price, the price gap between China and Western tio2 will be again enlarged. So the Chinese manufactures do belive that there could be another chance of the increasing. But will it come out as they expected?</li></ul><h2 id="Forcasting"><a href="#Forcasting" class="headerlink" title="Forcasting"></a>Forcasting</h2><p>It is the last radiance of the setting sun.</p><ul><li>Since the mid of Oct. 2021 the market is in chill. The manufacturers did not get orders abundant enough as they did in the first half of this year. Some of them even start to reducing the price to test the market. And there are still no new booming of the orders.</li><li>The cost is not incresing, this time the increase is not stand on a solid ground.</li><li>All the announced increasing is effected on Jan 1st. 2022 instead of next week or immediately as they did before. So they are more likely testing the market other than determined increasing.</li></ul><p>So we do have reasons to believe that after the Chinese New Year, without seeing orders booming, the decrease will start sliently. And trust me, more and more suppliers will start to contact you actively.<br>All in all, buy in needs.</p>]]></content>

After the increasing wave in late of Oct.2021, the market is far more weaker than expected. After breaking the record time again and again, the market finally calms down a little bit. And people are waiting to the ChinaCoat2021, and expecting a drop after that.</p><p>But with a new wave of the covid pandemic in China, the Chinacoat 2021 was cancelled naturally, which hits the watchers in the front head. This cancelling certainly makes it more difficult for the manufactures to act in the same pace and embracing orders with a lower price. Even now, the orders are not that abundant, but to most of the manufactures, the orders at hand are enough for them to pass this year. To the coming 2022, who knows?</p><p>To sulphate process tio2, the needs is certainly weak, due to the uncontrolled pandemic in east asia, which affects the demands of total in a short well. Besides that, the Indian market is watching and waitting a turning point cause their demands fulfilled already.<br>But, the new demands will apprear.<br>And the manufacturers are betting on the 2022 Winter Olympics, cause by then, the government will take production restrict measures as they did in 2008 summer Olympics. If so, the supply will drop significantly and the demands will recover. That is why now, the willingness to decrease the price is not strong. Even they decrease the price now, they have to adjust it back after 1 month, so why should they do it?</p><p>Anyway, we do belive that the price wave started from July this year is going to the end. There are good reasons to belive that the price already hit or will soon hit the peak and turn for a long period of dropping. With all kinds of reasons to back it up, the drops will be easy and slow if no black swans anymore.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Kenmare Resources’ ilmenite production of 314,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, an 87% increase compared to Q3 2020, the first full quarter’s production at nameplate capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite, setting a new record.</p><span id="more"></span><p><strong>Kenmare Resources plc (“Kenmare” or “the Company” or “the Group”)<br>14 October 2021<br>Q3 2021 Production Report</strong></p><p>Kenmare Resources plc (LSE:KMR, ISE:KMR), one of the leading global producers of titanium minerals and zircon, which operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the “Mine” or “Moma”) in northern Mozambique, is pleased to provide a trading update for the quarter ending 30 September 2021 (“Q3 2021”).</p><p><strong>Statement from Michael Carvill, Managing Director:</strong></p><p>“Q3 2021 represents the first quarter of ilmenite production at nameplate capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum, an 87% increase on the production achieved in Q3 2020. Despite expected lower grades in Q4, we remain confident in the outlook for 2021 annual production and re-iterate our guidance of 1.1-1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite.</p><p>Whilst we continue to remain vigilant against the threats posed by COVID-19, I am pleased to report that over 90% of our employees have now received two doses of vaccine. I’m also delighted to report that this quarter’s record production was achieved with no Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and, in the past few days, we’ve achieved a new company record of 5 million man hours worked without an LTI.</p><p>Market conditions for all products remained strong in Q3 2021 with pricing strengthening quarter on quarter, a robust order book in place and positive outlook across markets.”</p><p><strong>Q3 2021 overview</strong></p><ul><li>Improved Lost time injury frequency rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.08 per 200,000 hours worked to 30 September 2021 (30 September 2020: 0.29), zero lost time injuries recorded during the quarter</li><li>More than 90% of Mine employees have now received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine</li><li>Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 413,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, a 60% increase compared to Q3 2020, in line with expectations</li><li>Ilmenite production of 314,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, an 87% increase compared to Q3 2020, the first full quarter’s production at nameplate capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite, setting a new record</li><li>Primary zircon production of 15,700 tonnes, representing a 44% increase compared to Q3 2020, benefitting from increased HMC production</li><li>Total shipments of finished products of 322,600 tonnes, a 173% increase compared to Q3 2020</li><li>Guidance for 2021 reiterated at 1.1-1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite, plus associated by-prodcuts</li><li>Demand for Kenmare’s products remained robust in Q3 2021, supporting strong sales volumes and further price increases</li></ul><p><strong>Operations update</strong></p><h2 id="Table-Operational-results-for-the-Moma-Mine-in-Q3-2021-were-as-follows"><a href="#Table-Operational-results-for-the-Moma-Mine-in-Q3-2021-were-as-follows" class="headerlink" title="Table-Operational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2021 were as follows"></a>Table-Operational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2021 were as follows</h2><p><img src="/2021/10/18/Kenmare-Resources-titanium-ore-output-in-the-third-quarter-hits-a-record/table1.jpg"></p><ul><li>Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses.</li><li>Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.</li></ul><p>Kenmare’s rolling 12 month lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the 12 months to 30 September 2021 was 0.08 per 200,000 man-hours worked (30 September 2020: 0.29), with no LTIs recorded in Q3 2021. 4.9 million LTI free hours worked completed by the end of Q3 2021.</p><p>HMC production was 413,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, a 60% increase compared to Q3 2020 (258,000 tonnes) due primarily to a combination of higher tonnes of ore excavated due to a full period of WCP B mining in this period and higher grades. Ore grades in Q3 2021 were 4.83%, up 35% on Q3 2020 (3.58%) as a result of WCP B mining in the Pilivili zone. As previously announced, grades are expected to fall to ~3.8% in Q4 2021, before normalising at around 4.1% for 2022.</p><p>Production of all finished products increased substantially in Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020. This was due to a 64% increase in HMC consumption, benefitting from higher HMC availability. Ilmenite production was 314,400 tonnes, representing an 87% increase compared to Q3 2020 (167,900 tonnes), higher than the increase in HMC consumption, benefitting from increased ilmenite content in the HMC and improved recoveries relative to Q3 2020.</p><p>Primary zircon production was 15,700 tonnes, representing a 44% increase compared to Q3 2020 (10,900 tonnes), lower than the increased HMC consumption, due to lower zircon contained in the HMC (particularly at WCP B) and a temporary increase in intermediate stockpiles. Rutile production was 2,700 tonnes, a 69% increase (Q3 2020: 1,600 tonnes) as the recovery improvement programme delivered positive results. Concentrates production was 11,900 tonnes, a 32% increase compared to Q3 2020 (9,000 tonnes), reflecting a temporary increase in secondary zircon intermediate stock.</p><p>Kenmare shipped 322,600 tonnes of finished products during the quarter, which represents a 173% increase compared to Q3 2020 (118,000 tonnes), as steady shipments were made through the period. This comprised 283,400 tonnes of ilmenite, 18,800 tonnes of primary zircon, 3,600 tonnes of rutile and 16,800 tonnes of concentrates.</p><p>Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2021 was 21,000 tonnes, compared with 34,300 tonnes at the end of Q2 2021. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2021 was 186,300 tonnes, compared to 164,100 tonnes at the end of Q2 2021.</p><p><strong>Capital projects update</strong></p><p>The ramp up of the HMC pumping system from Pilivili has continued to progress. Less road haulage was required in the quarter and is now being wound down. The overall forecast capital cost for the WCP B project remains in line with prior guidance of US$127 million.</p><p>The Rotary Uninteruptible Power Supply (RUPS) project has moved into the execution phase with civil engineering and building construction underway. Fabrication of the RUPS units is complete and transportation to site is underway. The project is expected to be completed in Q1 2022.</p><p>Work on the Nataka Prefeasibility Study (PFS) continues. Detailed orebody investigations are progressing well with a view to optimally mining with WCP A at Nataka from 2025. It is expected that the PFS will be finalised in 2022.</p><p>Market update</p><p>Demand for Kenmare’s products remained robust in Q3 2021, supporting strong sales volumes and further price increases.</p><p>The recovery in the downstream titanium markets continued, supporting high utilisations at pigment plants globally and strong demand from titanium metal producers. In 2021, despite an increase in the supply of ilmenite from mines in China and concentrate products from Mozambique, the market has continued to be tight. Positive momentum continued in Q3 2021, as demand for ilmenite product to upgrade into high-grade feedstocks continued to grow strongly in China.</p><p>The outlook for Q4 2021 remains positive, with a strong order book in place. The Company continues to monitor the impact of power disruption to downstream industries in China, and the potential effect on demand related to the uncertainty in the Chinese real estate market. However, demand remains strong from our customers in China, and elsewhere, into Q4 and global feedstock inventories remain at low levels.</p><p>Demand for zircon improved in Q3 2021, as major economies continued the recovery from COVID-19 restrictions being lifted. Demand from the ceramics and foundry industries has recovered particularly quickly. In China, Kenmare’s zircon concentrate benefited from a tight spot market. Coupled with supply disruptions, the strong demand has resulted in an undersupplied market and prices for zircon are expected to increase again in Q4 following increases in Q2 and Q3.</p><p>The detailed report <a href="https://ir.q4europe.com/Solutions/Kenmare2018tf/3908/newsArticle.aspx?storyid=15215858">Kenmare Resources plc 2021Q3 2021 Production Report</a></p>]]></content>

This morning, the hot coal stocks and power stocks collapsed.</p><p>The largest flood peak in 40 years, the suspension of railroad tracks, tens of thousands of people were transferred, 126 mines were closed!<br><img src="/2021/10/11/China-Coal-Hub-Suspends-Mines-After-Floods-During-Energy-Crisis/shanxi-floods-slides.gif" alt="Floods in Shanxi caused mountain slides"><br>Following the heavy rains in Henan, Shanxi suffered heavy rainfall.</p><p>According to news from China Weather Network on October 7th, during the National Day holiday this year, Shanxi was hit by heavy rainfall. Among the 117 counties (cities, districts) in the province, 18 counties (cities, districts) had precipitation exceeding 200 mm, and precipitation in many places broke. Record in early October. Data shows that from 20:00 on the 2nd to 20:00 on the 6th, most areas of Taiyuan, Yangquan, Linfen, Changzhi, Lvliang, and Jinzhong set a record of accumulated rainfall in the first ten days of October. Heavy rainfall has caused waterlogging, geological disasters, floods and other disasters in many places. Shanxi Province has launched a level III emergency response to geological disasters.</p><p>*** Affected by the heavy rain, as of 8 o’clock on October 4, Shanxi had transferred a total of 10,704 people, suspended production of 27 coal mines, 99 non-coal mines, 7 hazardous chemical enterprises, suspended construction of 231 projects in progress, and closed 74 scenic spots.***</p><p><strong>Shanxi has regained its status as the largest coal-producing province</strong></p><p>Increased pressure on coal supply under heavy rainfall</p><p>Since the end of August, power supply shortages have occurred in many parts of the country, and power restrictions and production restrictions have also occurred from time to time. As the main force of domestic power supply, coal-fired power generation is limited due to the tight coal supply and demand and restrictions on thermal coal prices repeatedly hitting historical highs.</p><p>In the context of the current thermal coal market, which is already tight in supply and demand, more than 20 coal mines in Shanxi Province have been closed due to flood control needs, triggering concerns that the thermal coal market will have a larger gap after the holiday.</p><p>Shanxi Province is the largest coal-producing province in China, with over 600 coal mines announced in the province. In the “Announcement on the Production Capacity of the Province’s Production Coal Mines” published by the Shanxi Provincial Energy Bureau on September 6, a total of 682 coal mines are listed, including some coal mines that have been cancelled (recoverable), with an annual production capacity ranging from several hundred thousand tons to two thousand tons. Ranging from ten million tons.</p><p>According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2020, the total output of raw coal above designated size nationwide will be 3.84 billion tons, an increase of 0.9% year-on-year; among them, the output of raw coal in Shanxi Province in 2020 will be 1.063 billion tons, becoming the second annual output of raw coal in domestic history to exceed 1 billion. Ton province, and surpassed Inner Mongolia in terms of output, becoming the country’s largest coal-producing province again.</p><p>As a major domestic coal producer, Shanxi Province has recently undertaken the task of ensuring coal supply in the fourth quarter in more than a dozen provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.</p><p>According to Xinhua News Agency, on September 29, the fourth quarter coal mid-to-long-term contract signing meeting for the 14 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in Shanxi Province was held in Taiyuan, Shanxi. In accordance with relevant requirements, the central coal enterprises in Shanxi will guarantee supply to 5 provinces and cities including Tianjin, Fujian, Hebei, Guangdong and Liaoning, and Jinneng Holding Group will connect with 6 provinces, regions and cities including Guangxi, Jiangsu, Jilin, Anhui, Shanghai, and Zhejiang; Shanxi Coking Coal Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Henan Province; Huayang New Material Technology Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Hainan Province; Lu’an Chemical Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Shandong Province, and the remaining tasks of guaranteeing supply are undertaken by coal companies in Shanxi Province.</p><p>According to the 21st Century Business Herald, Meierya Futures believes that the 27 coal mines in Shanxi that will stop production may cause a bigger gap after the holiday, and the coal industry’s capacity contraction is superimposed on the dual control of energy consumption and increased demand. Time seems hard to see signs of improvement.</p><p>The latest research report of Guotai Junan also stated that the global energy shortage is a foregone conclusion, coal prices are still expected to rise more than expected in October, and the gap of thermal coal in the dynamic peak season will be further enlarged.</p><p>According to the China Fund News, some institutions said that during the National Day, more than 20 coal mines in Shanxi were closed due to flood control, which may cause a larger gap after the holiday. Although there are sporadic imports of coal into Hong Kong, the effect remains to be seen. In terms of imported Mongolian coal, it is still difficult to increase Mongolian coal in the later period, which is relatively supportive for high-priced coking coal. The follow-up focus will be on the progress of the reduction of crude steel, the extent to which it affects the demand for bi-coke, and whether the thermal coal supply policy can increase the supply of coal blending.</p>]]></content>
