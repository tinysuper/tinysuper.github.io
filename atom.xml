    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Daniel Moog</strong></p><p>The high-quality white pigment titanium dioxide has many applications. Coagulation or agglomeration of a TiO2 dispersion must be avoided at all costs, both in the manufacturing process and in the processing, e.g. by manufacturers of paints and coatings. This applies in particular to highly filled systems, such as pigment preparations and pigment pastes, where a high degree of particle stabilization is indispensable.</p><!-- more --><p>Purely electrostatic stabilization is not sufficient to stabilize highly concentrated pigment preparations and pigment pastes in such a way that they do not exhibit flocculation and segregation states during storage and processing.</p><p>For this reason, highly filled systems are stabilized either purely sterically or in a certain ratio of electrostatic and steric stabilization. Stabilization with electrostatic and steric components is referred to as electro-steric stabilization.</p><p>Illustration of the measurement setup<br><img src="https://analytik.news/en/grafik/papers/1131_1.jpg" alt="Fig.1: Illustration of the measurement setup"><br>Fig.1: Illustration of the measurement setup<br>(a) ESA probe, (b) measurement chamber,<br>(c) mechanical stirrer, (d) pipette,<br>(e) dispersion, (f) pH probe and<br>(g) conductivity probe. [Source:<br>“Electroacoustic Quantification of Surface<br>Bound Ligands in Functionalized Silica and<br>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles”, Whiley Publishers]<br>By adjusting the ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization, it may be possible to adjust the viscosity properties of the products. To maintain structural viscosity properties, as is often required in the field of paints and coatings, electrostatic stabilization is often necessary. For viscosities that should be independent of the shear rate (Newtonian viscosity behavior), purely steric stabilization may be useful.</p><p>The electroacoustic ESA measuring technique used is used to record the stabilization process during the addition of additives to an aqueous TiO2 pigment preparation (Figure 1). The measured data show the level and type of stabilization as a function of the added additive concentration. By using the ESA method, additive concentrations can be determined which lead to defined electro-steric or steric stabilization ratios. These dispersion states, which are now known, can then be transferred to the formulation development or formulation optimization of a pigment preparation.</p><p>In summary, the following advantages result from the use of the ESA measuring technique for recording a stabilization process through the addition of additives:</p><ul><li>Assignment of quantitative stability states to the added additive quantities.</li><li>Exact adjustment of electro-steric or pure steric stabilization states.</li><li>Avoidance of additive excess by detection of the complete surface coverage with the surface affine additive groups.</li><li>Estimation of the polymer layer thickness applied to the particles by the electrical double layer.</li><li>Control of dispersion products after storage or in production.</li><li>Evaluation of the ESA raw data signal enables measurement and evaluation without knowledge of the physical substance data.

The measurements were carried out by the company Pulveranalyse Dipl.-Ing. Daniel Moog, a contract laboratory specializing in dispersion analysis.

The wetting and coating of the TiO2 pigment surfaces with the additive polymer leads to a decrease in the zeta potential, which is also a measure of the thickness of the applied polymer layer. The ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization can be detected and thus precisely adjusted.</p><p>zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment<br>Fig.2: Recording of the decrease of the zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment during additive addition.

The results show that the recommended additive concentrations of the additive manufacturers are good guidelines, but that the surface chemistry of the titanium dioxide pigments can vary so much due to post-treatment processes and manufacturing methods that for many TiO2-pigment grades a precise adjustment of the formulation is necessary. This is especially true when highly filled systems are manufactured at the maximum possible concentration, as is the case with pigment formulations and pigment pastes.<br>Conclusion<br>The ESA technique used in the present experiments has been elaborated in a particular way for different applications.</p><p>In the technical production process, dispersions are usually highly concentrated, turbid, colored or tempered. They are often electrostatically influenced by added additive formulations. Often the sedimentation of the mixture in the reactor must be prevented by powerful agitators. Stability analysis by means of electrokinetic sonic amplitude includes all parameters. Thus, the data of the samples analyzed in highly concentrated form can be directly transferred to the electrokinetic properties of the dispersed particles in the raw material or in the finished product.</p><p>By controlled recording of the stabilization process, it was possible to develop a stable semi-finished product with TINOX R-2140 as a pigment preparation with 78% TiO2 for aqueous dip coating applications, which showed no tendency to agglomeration even during subsequent strong dilution processes. The stabilization process could be deciphered a bit further and the dispersion states can be checked by means of ESA technology for process and quality control (see illustration Figure 4).</p><p>metrological recording of stabilization prozess<br>Fig.4: Illustration of the metrological recording of the stabilization process.<br><img src="https://analytik.news/en/grafik/papers/1131_4.jpg" alt="Illustration of the metrological recording of the stabilization process."></p><p>Information on the measurement method used<br>From a scientific point of view, the use of the ESA measurement technique is a method for direct quantification of accessible hydroxide groups on the surface of particles and a profound way for surface quantification of different ligands. While electrophoretic methods for zeta potential surface characterization for technical applications are limited by too high dilutions, sedimentation processes, irregular particle shape or inaccessible physical substance data, the ESA method is a complementary measurement technique for analysis in technical applications.</p><p>The ESA method for characterizing the charge stability of particles in a dispersion is an electroacoustic measurement technique.</p><p>An oscillating voltage is applied to a suspension, dispersion or emulsion, which is generated by an alternating current source. Charged particles in the dispersion oscillate at the frequency of the externally applied electric field. One or more frequencies can be applied. The oscillation of the particles at these frequencies generates sonic waves. The amplitudes of these sonic waves are measured as electrokinetic sonic amplitude (ESA). This ESA signal is proportional to the dynamic mobility of the particles and this in turn is proportional to the zeta potential of the particles present in the dispersion. A prerequisite for the use of this effect is a certain density difference between dispersion medium and particle. To generate evaluable signals, this density difference must be at least 0.2 g/cm3.</p></body></html>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>Recently, a number of titanium dioxide manufacturers said that the global demand for titanium dioxide is strong and the supply is tight, and the market price may continue to rise. Major producers Chemours, Venator, Tronox and Kronos reported positive results in the first quarter and expect their performance to continue to grow for the rest of this year.</p><!-- more --><h3 id="Increase-in-sales-and-decrease-in-inventory"><a href="#Increase-in-sales-and-decrease-in-inventory" class="headerlink" title="Increase in sales and decrease in inventory"></a>Increase in sales and decrease in inventory</h3><p>“Chemours’ sales in the first quarter increased by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The demand for coatings, plastics and laminates in Chemours’ titanium technology business continued to increase in the second quarter.” Chemours President and CEO Mark P. Vergnano stated on the May 4 earnings conference call, “In the first half of this year, new houses and renovations in various countries are driving the rapid growth of demand for architectural coatings. Since 2020, the demand for DIY products has maintained a strong momentum.”<br>John D. Romano from Tronox said that the sales volume of titanium dioxide in the first quarter increased by 15% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Demand in various regions was strong, but the largest growth was in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Simon Turner, chief executive officer of Venator, also said that market demand has unexpectedly grown strongly. All industries and regions have strong demand for functional titanium dioxide. The demand for specialty titanium dioxide products has shown a good momentum of recovery, mainly in the textile and automotive industries. Venator’s titanium dioxide sales volume has continuously increased by 14%. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, the device utilization rate has increased, and the inventory remains tight throughout the first quarter.</p><h3 id="Demand-is-back-on-track"><a href="#Demand-is-back-on-track" class="headerlink" title="Demand is back on track"></a>Demand is back on track</h3><p>The overall demand for titanium dioxide has basically returned to the level before the epidemic. The Kronos report shows that sales in the first quarter of this year were 141,000 tons, an increase of 4% from 136,000 tons in the same period last year, and an increase of 14% from 124,000 tons in the second quarter of 2020. The total sales volume in the third quarter of last year was 136,000 tons and the fourth quarter was 135,000 tons. Other manufacturers did not report sales, but their year-on-year sales growth data showed the same trend. Chemours’ titanium dioxide sales in the first quarter of this year increased by 16% year-on-year, while the first quarter of 2020 increased by 19% year-on-year, and the second quarter of 2020 decreased by 9% year-on-year. Tronox’s sales in the first quarter of this year increased by 16% year-on-year, the first quarter of last year sales increased by 6% year-on-year, and the second quarter fell by 27% year-on-year. Venators’ sales volume of Titanium Dioxide in the first quarter of this year was down 1% year-on-year, and in the second quarter of 2020, it was down 21% year-on-year.<br>Chemours Chief Operating Officer Mark Newman said: “The recovery in demand for titanium dioxide started when DIY products were launched in the second quarter of last year. Architectural coatings accounted for most of the company’s titanium dioxide business, and the rest was laminate and plastics business. Then there is the construction industry demand, especially the demand for new housing, which is growing rapidly. Based on the current development trend, sales are expected to increase in the next three quarters.”</p><h3 id="Supply-tends-to-be-tight"><a href="#Supply-tends-to-be-tight" class="headerlink" title="Supply tends to be tight"></a>Supply tends to be tight</h3><p>After the collapse of demand in the second quarter of last year, titanium dioxide producers around the world have drastically reduced their production, and then the slow recovery of production has resulted in a tight supply situation. Newman said: “Judging from the operation of our factory in March and April, our production in the second quarter will be higher than that in the first quarter. In addition, in terms of the supply of each factory, the supply of raw materials is restricted, but these are all It’s only a temporary impact.”  Venator also expressed a similar view.<br>Although the price of titanium dioxide is rising in the first quarter of this year, it has not fully recovered. At the same time, production costs are also increasing. Hassan Ahmed, an analyst at Alembic Global Advisors, an American investment research company, predicts that the price of titanium dioxide will continue to push up this year. He pointed out in a recent research report: “The current titanium dioxide price is only slightly higher than the 16-year average level and the 2008-2009 crisis period, so the upward potential is greater.” The price of ilmentile continues to rise, which may further push the price of titanium dioxide increasing.<br>Turner pointed out that China’s exports remained stable in the first quarter of this year, and the main export markets were other Asian countries and emerging markets. He said: “Due to the strong local demand for titanium dioxide in China, coupled with transportation restrictions, China’s exports to Europe and North America will fall, which will make customers more hope that we can provide reliable supplies.” Due to rising raw material and transportation costs, Chinese titanium dioxide producers are also continuously increasing their sales prices, thereby continuing to narrow the arbitrage space.<br>According to relevant data, Chemours, Venator, Tronox and Kronox together account for 40% of the global titanium dioxide production capacity, with a total global production capacity of 8.4 million tons/year in 2020. Chemours has the largest production capacity, about 1.2 million tons/year; followed by Tronox with 1 million tons/year;  Venator and Kronox both have 500,000 tons/year. In the past 10 years, China’s titanium dioxide production capacity has surged, from 2.1 million tons/year in 2011 to 3.7 million tons/year in 2020, accounting for 44% of the world’s total production capacity. During the same period, China’s annual net exports increased from 41,000 tons to 69,000 tons.</p></body></html>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>With the recovery in Europe and America, the demand for titanium raw materials by European and American companies is also recovering. It is understood that driven by the growth of demand in Europe and the United States, ILUKA’s rutile quotation in the third quarter rose from the previous US$1,495/ton to US$1,640/ton. In addition to ILUKA, some foreign companies have also raised the price of 95 rutile. At present, the international quotations of 95 rutiles are all above US$1,600/ton, and the supply exceeds demand. According to several rutile manufacturers, the current western downstream users are more active in purchasing rutile raw materials, and the spot supply of rutile is tight.</p><p>In May, ILUKA announced that it would suspend the production of rutile mines in Sierra Leone after November this year, which will cause the global supply of rutile to drop by more than 140,000 tons per year. At the same time, the safety accident at Rio Tinto’s South Africa plant has made the plant’s future stability of high-titanium slag supply uncertain. If the output of ILUKA rutile is reduced while Rio Tinto’s South Africa titanium slag plant also sees a decline in output, then the global supply of high-grade titanium-rich materials at the end of this year will not be optimistic.</p><p>Judging from the current situation, the market prices of high-titanium slag and rutile have been determined to rise slightly in the third quarter. If the supply situation of Rio Tinto’s South Africa plant does fluctuate at the end of this year, the global price of rutile and titanium slag may rise sharply again in the fourth quarter. Some industry insiders believe that the price of 95 rutile may exceed US$1,800/ton by then. According to relevant analysis, customers in the welding consumables industry may be the most affected in the short term. Because other industries such as the chloride process titanium dioxide plant can choose the raw materials of high-titanium slag, artificial rutile, and natural rutile, while the welding material industry relies heavily on natural rutile and is more difficult to replace with other products.</p></body></html>]]></content>

Since March, the price of 90 titanium slag has risen at a relatively large pace, mostly around 400 yuan/ton. The slowdown in the price increase this time indicates that the high-titanium slag market will enter a period of relatively stable prices in the future.</p><p>The reason why the price of high-titanium slag rose sharply in March and April was mainly due to the rapid increase in the price of ilmenite leading to rising costs. Recently, the northern high-titanium slag enterprises have gradually completed the establishment of ilmenite inventory, and the average ilmenite inventory is about 2-3 months. Therefore, the production cost of high-titanium slag in the north will be relatively stable in the future, and a single increase of 400 yuan/ton will temporarily bid farewell to the market. From a long-term trend, with the gradual resumption of production of western titanium dioxide companies, the demand for ilmenite in the West will also gradually increase, and the corresponding supply to the Chinese market will decrease. The recent discovery of a mutated new coronavirus in Vietnam has brought certain uncertainty to the future market trend. The Vietnamese market is my country’s main source of titanium slag raw materials. Although the supply has declined in recent years, it has maintained a relatively stable supply. In contrast, although ilmenite from Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Falkland Islands, and Norway appeared on the market some time ago, they cannot become a stable source. If the spread of the new coronavirus in Vietnam affects its export of ilmenite to my country, it may push up the price of domestic titanium chloride ore in the future. After the current inventory of ilmenite in the titanium slag plant is exhausted, the price of titanium slag may change again due to the cost of ilmenite.</p></body></html>]]></content>

As we all know, in the past, more and more users are shitfing to the Rutile grades due to its outstanding performance comparing with Anatase. But now, we found that, many users are shifting back to Anatase due the crazy price increase of Rutile, to whom a little compromise in quality is not a serious issue.  But more importantly, most of the producers of Anatase already shift their production line to Rutile and not willing to shit it back yet.

Still the market is quiet this week, nobody is making noise at this point of time.

The demands is still at a low level, but the turning point of the crazy trend still not show up.

Why?
 1. The expectation of the price increase in July is strong. In april and last month, Kronos, Venat&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

Inadvertently, titanium dioxide has been rising for 11 consecutive months, and the fifth round of price increases this year has also landed one after another, and the record for the longest product price increase is about to be broken.</p><h2 id="The-price-hike-lasted-for-nearly-a-year"><a href="#The-price-hike-lasted-for-nearly-a-year" class="headerlink" title="The price hike lasted for nearly a year"></a>The price hike lasted for nearly a year</h2><p>On May 10, the leader of the titanium dioxide industry, Lomon Baili(Known as LomonBillions), issued an announcement stating that, according to the current domestic and international titanium dioxide market conditions, the company will start from now on all types of titanium dioxide (including sulfuric acid titanium dioxide, chloride titanium dioxide) On the basis of the original price, the sales price will be raised by RMB 1,000/ton for various domestic customers and USD 150/ton for international customers.</p><p>Prior to this, another leading company in the industry, CNNC HUA YUAN Titanium Dioxide Co., Ltd(Known as CHTI), also issued a price adjustment announcement, stating that the overall increase in the sales price of the company’s main products will help further enhance the company’s continued profitability and improve the company’s market position and influence. It is expected to have an impact on the company’s operations. The results will have a positive impact.</p><p>The price adjustments of Lomon Baili and CNNC HUA YUAN Titanium Dioxide Co., Ltd are not alone. After the May 1st holiday, the titanium dioxide price market has remained strong and stable.</p><p>“At present, more than ten manufacturers including Anada, Hengtong Titanium, Longteng Titanium, Jiangsu Zhentai, Shandong Dongjia, Jinpu Titanium, Shandong Dawn, etc. have sent letters announcing an increase of 1,000 yuan/ton, in addition to Southwest etc. Several producers in the region went straight up by 800-1000 yuan/ton without letter, continuing the bullish market sentiment. The price market is already the fifth round of price increases this year.” Yan Ti analyst Yang Xun said.</p><p>Yang Xun introduced that the mainstream prices of most domestic sulfuric acid rutile and anatase titanium dioxides currently range from 19,800 to 21,000 yuan/ton and 18,300 to 19,000 yuan/ton. Domestic and imported chlorinated rutile titanium dioxides differentiate the mainstream prices by use At 21500-23500 yuan / ton and 27000-28500 yuan / ton (the above are all tax-included cash outbound prices). Since July 2020, the titanium dioxide market has been rising for 11 consecutive months, almost equal to the longest continuous rise record of titanium dioxide in 2016. The price market continues to be strong, and the price of holders is relatively hard. For low-price inquiries More resistant, more inclined to cash orders.</p><p>Zhuochuang analyst Tian Xiaoyu also said that the current domestic titanium dioxide market has been rising for 11 months, and the market price will also break through the historical high since 2012. During the period, as the most upstream of the titanium dioxide industry chain, titanium concentrate performed more prominently. In the second half of 2020 alone, the growth rate exceeded 65%, and in some stages it provided strong cost support for the price of titanium dioxide.</p><h2 id="Cost-support-high-price-continuation"><a href="#Cost-support-high-price-continuation" class="headerlink" title="Cost support high price continuation"></a>Cost support high price continuation</h2><p>What are the factors supporting the continued increase in the price of titanium dioxide? Is the price increase sustainable?</p><p>Yang Xun said that the current trading market is still very confrontational, and the price market is in a state of gaming. In terms of demand, industries such as plastic color masterbatches have entered the off-season, and overall demand has declined. At the same time, the downward transmission of costs is difficult, and it is more resistant to high-priced titanium dioxide, and production is simply stopped. In addition, high-priced titanium dioxide forces end customers to try alternatives. However, on the supply side, titanium concentrates are always tight and expensive, and the raw material cost of titanium dioxide remains high.</p><p>At present, the market has a large number of foreign trade orders, and the main manufacturers have received orders until June. The vast majority of manufacturers and distributors are tight in stock, especially some of the main brand products. What needs attention is that environmental inspections and emergencies have also caused some regional producers to suspend production, causing production capacity to shrink.</p><h2 id="Cost-support-is-indeed-one-of-the-main-reasons-why-the-price-of-titanium-dioxide-continues-to-rise"><a href="#Cost-support-is-indeed-one-of-the-main-reasons-why-the-price-of-titanium-dioxide-continues-to-rise" class="headerlink" title="Cost support is indeed one of the main reasons why the price of titanium dioxide continues to rise."></a>Cost support is indeed one of the main reasons why the price of titanium dioxide continues to rise.</h2><p>“Titanium concentrate is the main and important raw material in the production of titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide accounts for nearly 96% of the downstream consumption of titanium concentrate. Others are mostly used in the manufacture of sponge titanium. Since the bottom of the price in 2020, the price of titanium concentrate has doubled. The current national market average price is 2450 yuan/ton. At the end of April, major Panxi major manufacturers raised their sales guidance prices for May by 80-100 yuan/ton. Supported by the price of titanium concentrates on the main cost surface, the domestic titanium dioxide market after Labor Day A new round of growth has begun.” Tian Xiaoyu said.</p><p>Regarding the market outlook, Yang Xun believes that in the short term, the game between supply and demand is obvious, demand enters the off-season, and the terminal is more resistant to high-level titanium dioxide; supply-side manufacturers have high costs, smooth exports, tight spot prices, and low start-ups. Without the support of demand, the mid- to long-term market trend is still unclear, but the profit in May is as expected, and the current real order price is strong and firm.</p></body></html>]]></content>
