Market transactions are at a standstill, with high prices for raw materials and high production costs at processing plants. Some companies have temporarily stabilized their quotations, and there is a strong sense of caution in the titanium ore market.</p><p><strong>Titanium Slag:</strong> In December, northern enterprises quoted a price of 6,950 CNY&#x2F;ton for 90% low-calcium-magnesium high-titanium slag, which is an increase of 200 CNY&#x2F;ton from the previous month. The cost of raw materials remains high, leading to pressure from high slag costs. There is a tight supply of goods in the north, and market quotations are firm. Converted price is approximately $955.51 USD&#x2F;ton.</p><p><strong>Titanium Tetrachloride:</strong> The market price for titanium tetrachloride is between 6,000 and 6,400 CNY&#x2F;ton. The cost is at a high level, and prices are stable. The downstream sponge titanium market has risen again, which may benefit the titanium tetrachloride market in the future.

Previous market orders were stable, and current orders are gradually reducing market inventory. Given the cost prices, sponge titanium prices are steadily rising.

The downstream market is weak, and the high-titanium slag market is also running weakly. The bidding price for 85% low-calcium, magnesium high-titanium slag in Yunnan has not been announced yet.
