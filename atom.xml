After the increasing wave in late of Oct.2021, the market is far more weaker than expected. After breaking the record time again and again, the market finally calms down a little bit. And people are waiting to the ChinaCoat2021, and expecting a drop after that.</p><p>But with a new wave of the covid pandemic in China, the Chinacoat 2021 was cancelled naturally, which hits the watchers in the front head. This cancelling certainly makes it more difficult for the manufactures to act in the same pace and embracing orders with a lower price. Even now, the orders are not that abundant, but to most of the manufactures, the orders at hand are enough for them to pass this year. To the coming 2022, who knows?</p><p>To sulphate process tio2, the needs is certainly weak, due to the uncontrolled pandemic in east asia, which affects the demands of total in a short well. Besides that, the Indian market is watching and waitting a turning point cause their demands fulfilled already.<br>But, the new demands will apprear.<br>And the manufacturers are betting on the 2022 Winter Olympics, cause by then, the government will take production restrict measures as they did in 2008 summer Olympics. If so, the supply will drop significantly and the demands will recover. That is why now, the willingness to decrease the price is not strong. Even they decrease the price now, they have to adjust it back after 1 month, so why should they do it?</p><p>Anyway, we do belive that the price wave started from July this year is going to the end. There are good reasons to belive that the price already hit or will soon hit the peak and turn for a long period of dropping.

Despite expected lower grades in Q4, we remain confident in the outlook for 2021 annual production and re-iterate our guidance of 1.1-1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite.</p><p>Whilst we continue to remain vigilant against the threats posed by COVID-19, I am pleased to report that over 90% of our employees have now received two doses of vaccine. I’m also delighted to report that this quarter’s record production was achieved with no Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and, in the past few days, we’ve achieved a new company record of 5 million man hours worked without an LTI.</p><p>Market conditions for all products remained strong in Q3 2021 with pricing strengthening quarter on quarter, a robust order book in place and positive outlook across markets.”</p><p><strong>Q3 2021 overview</strong></p><ul><li>Improved Lost time injury frequency rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.08 per 200,000 hours worked to 30 September 2021 (30 September 2020: 0.29), zero lost time injuries recorded during the quarter</li><li>More than 90% of Mine employees have now received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine</li><li>Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 413,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, a 60% increase compared to Q3 2020, in line with expectations</li><li>Ilmenite production of 314,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, an 87% increase compared to Q3 2020, the first full quarter’s production at nameplate capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite, setting a new record</li><li>Primary zircon production of 15,700 tonnes, representing a 44% increase compared to Q3 2020, benefitting from increased HMC production</li><li>Total shipments of finished products of 322,600 tonnes, a 173% increase compared to Q3 2020</li><li>Guidance for 2021 reiterated at 1.1-1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite, plus associated by-prodcuts</li><li>Demand for Kenmare’s products remained robust in Q3 2021, supporting strong sales volumes and further price increases</li></ul><p><strong>Operations update</strong></p><h2 id="Table-Operational-results-for-the-Moma-Mine-in-Q3-2021-were-as-follows"><a href="#Table-Operational-results-for-the-Moma-Mine-in-Q3-2021-were-as-follows" class="headerlink" title="Table-Operational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2021 were as follows"></a>Table-Operational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2021 were as follows</h2><p><img src="/2021/10/18/Kenmare-Resources-titanium-ore-output-in-the-third-quarter-hits-a-record/table1.jpg"></p><ul><li>Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses.</li><li>Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.</li></ul><p>Kenmare’s rolling 12 month lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the 12 months to 30 September 2021 was 0.08 per 200,000 man-hours worked (30 September 2020: 0.29), with no LTIs recorded in Q3 2021. 4.9 million LTI free hours worked completed by the end of Q3 2021.</p><p>HMC production was 413,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, a 60% increase compared to Q3 2020 (258,000 tonnes) due primarily to a combination of higher tonnes of ore excavated due to a full period of WCP B mining in this period and higher grades. Ore grades in Q3 2021 were 4.83%, up 35% on Q3 2020 (3.58%) as a result of WCP B mining in the Pilivili zone. As previously announced, grades are expected to fall to ~3.8% in Q4 2021, before normalising at around 4.1% for 2022.</p><p>Production of all finished products increased substantially in Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020. This was due to a 64% increase in HMC consumption, benefitting from higher HMC availability. Ilmenite production was 314,400 tonnes, representing an 87% increase compared to Q3 2020 (167,900 tonnes), higher than the increase in HMC consumption, benefitting from increased ilmenite content in the HMC and improved recoveries relative to Q3 2020.</p><p>Primary zircon production was 15,700 tonnes, representing a 44% increase compared to Q3 2020 (10,900 tonnes), lower than the increased HMC consumption, due to lower zircon contained in the HMC (particularly at WCP B) and a temporary increase in intermediate stockpiles. Rutile production was 2,700 tonnes, a 69% increase (Q3 2020: 1,600 tonnes) as the recovery improvement programme delivered positive results. Concentrates production was 11,900 tonnes, a 32% increase compared to Q3 2020 (9,000 tonnes), reflecting a temporary increase in secondary zircon intermediate stock.</p><p>Kenmare shipped 322,600 tonnes of finished products during the quarter, which represents a 173% increase compared to Q3 2020 (118,000 tonnes), as steady shipments were made through the period. This comprised 283,400 tonnes of ilmenite, 18,800 tonnes of primary zircon, 3,600 tonnes of rutile and 16,800 tonnes of concentrates.</p><p>Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2021 was 21,000 tonnes, compared with 34,300 tonnes at the end of Q2 2021. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2021 was 186,300 tonnes, compared to 164,100 tonnes at the end of Q2 2021.</p><p><strong>Capital projects update</strong></p><p>The ramp up of the HMC pumping system from Pilivili has continued to progress. Less road haulage was required in the quarter and is now being wound down. The overall forecast capital cost for the WCP B project remains in line with prior guidance of US$127 million.</p><p>The Rotary Uninteruptible Power Supply (RUPS) project has moved into the execution phase with civil engineering and building construction underway. Fabrication of the RUPS units is complete and transportation to site is underway. The project is expected to be completed in Q1 2022.</p><p>Work on the Nataka Prefeasibility Study (PFS) continues. Detailed orebody investigations are progressing well with a view to optimally mining with WCP A at Nataka from 2025. It is expected that the PFS will be finalised in 2022.</p><p>Market update</p><p>Demand for Kenmare’s products remained robust in Q3 2021, supporting strong sales volumes and further price increases.</p><p>The recovery in the downstream titanium markets continued, supporting high utilisations at pigment plants globally and strong demand from titanium metal producers. In 2021, despite an increase in the supply of ilmenite from mines in China and concentrate products from Mozambique, the market has continued to be tight. Positive momentum continued in Q3 2021, as demand for ilmenite product to upgrade into high-grade feedstocks continued to grow strongly in China.</p><p>The outlook for Q4 2021 remains positive, with a strong order book in place. The Company continues to monitor the impact of power disruption to downstream industries in China, and the potential effect on demand related to the uncertainty in the Chinese real estate market. However, demand remains strong from our customers in China, and elsewhere, into Q4 and global feedstock inventories remain at low levels.</p><p>Demand for zircon improved in Q3 2021, as major economies continued the recovery from COVID-19 restrictions being lifted. Demand from the ceramics and foundry industries has recovered particularly quickly. In China, Kenmare’s zircon concentrate benefited from a tight spot market. Coupled with supply disruptions, the strong demand has resulted in an undersupplied market and prices for zircon are expected to increase again in Q4 following increases in Q2 and Q3.</p><p>The detailed report <a href="https://ir.q4europe.com/Solutions/Kenmare2018tf/3908/newsArticle.aspx?storyid=15215858">Kenmare Resources plc 2021Q3 2021 Production Report</a></p>]]></content>

Among the 117 counties (cities, districts) in the province, 18 counties (cities, districts) had precipitation exceeding 200 mm, and precipitation in many places broke. Record in early October. Data shows that from 20:00 on the 2nd to 20:00 on the 6th, most areas of Taiyuan, Yangquan, Linfen, Changzhi, Lvliang, and Jinzhong set a record of accumulated rainfall in the first ten days of October. Heavy rainfall has caused waterlogging, geological disasters, floods and other disasters in many places. Shanxi Province has launched a level III emergency response to geological disasters.</p><p>*** Affected by the heavy rain, as of 8 o’clock on October 4, Shanxi had transferred a total of 10,704 people, suspended production of 27 coal mines, 99 non-coal mines, 7 hazardous chemical enterprises, suspended construction of 231 projects in progress, and closed 74 scenic spots.***</p><p><strong>Shanxi has regained its status as the largest coal-producing province</strong></p><p>Increased pressure on coal supply under heavy rainfall</p><p>Since the end of August, power supply shortages have occurred in many parts of the country, and power restrictions and production restrictions have also occurred from time to time. As the main force of domestic power supply, coal-fired power generation is limited due to the tight coal supply and demand and restrictions on thermal coal prices repeatedly hitting historical highs.</p><p>In the context of the current thermal coal market, which is already tight in supply and demand, more than 20 coal mines in Shanxi Province have been closed due to flood control needs, triggering concerns that the thermal coal market will have a larger gap after the holiday.</p><p>Shanxi Province is the largest coal-producing province in China, with over 600 coal mines announced in the province. In the “Announcement on the Production Capacity of the Province’s Production Coal Mines” published by the Shanxi Provincial Energy Bureau on September 6, a total of 682 coal mines are listed, including some coal mines that have been cancelled (recoverable), with an annual production capacity ranging from several hundred thousand tons to two thousand tons. Ranging from ten million tons.</p><p>According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2020, the total output of raw coal above designated size nationwide will be 3.84 billion tons, an increase of 0.9% year-on-year; among them, the output of raw coal in Shanxi Province in 2020 will be 1.063 billion tons, becoming the second annual output of raw coal in domestic history to exceed 1 billion. Ton province, and surpassed Inner Mongolia in terms of output, becoming the country’s largest coal-producing province again.</p><p>As a major domestic coal producer, Shanxi Province has recently undertaken the task of ensuring coal supply in the fourth quarter in more than a dozen provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.</p><p>According to Xinhua News Agency, on September 29, the fourth quarter coal mid-to-long-term contract signing meeting for the 14 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in Shanxi Province was held in Taiyuan, Shanxi. In accordance with relevant requirements, the central coal enterprises in Shanxi will guarantee supply to 5 provinces and cities including Tianjin, Fujian, Hebei, Guangdong and Liaoning, and Jinneng Holding Group will connect with 6 provinces, regions and cities including Guangxi, Jiangsu, Jilin, Anhui, Shanghai, and Zhejiang; Shanxi Coking Coal Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Henan Province; Huayang New Material Technology Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Hainan Province; Lu’an Chemical Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Shandong Province, and the remaining tasks of guaranteeing supply are undertaken by coal companies in Shanxi Province.</p><p>According to the 21st Century Business Herald, Meierya Futures believes that the 27 coal mines in Shanxi that will stop production may cause a bigger gap after the holiday, and the coal industry’s capacity contraction is superimposed on the dual control of energy consumption and increased demand. Time seems hard to see signs of improvement.</p><p>The latest research report of Guotai Junan also stated that the global energy shortage is a foregone conclusion, coal prices are still expected to rise more than expected in October, and the gap of thermal coal in the dynamic peak season will be further enlarged.</p><p>According to the China Fund News, some institutions said that during the National Day, more than 20 coal mines in Shanxi were closed due to flood control, which may cause a larger gap after the holiday. Although there are sporadic imports of coal into Hong Kong, the effect remains to be seen. In terms of imported Mongolian coal, it is still difficult to increase Mongolian coal in the later period, which is relatively supportive for high-priced coking coal. The follow-up focus will be on the progress of the reduction of crude steel, the extent to which it affects the demand for bi-coke, and whether the thermal coal supply policy can increase the supply of coal blending.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Daniel Moog</strong></p><p>The high-quality white pigment titanium dioxide has many applications. Coagulation or agglomeration of a TiO2 dispersion must be avoided at all costs, both in the manufacturing process and in the processing, e.g. by manufacturers of paints and coatings. This applies in particular to highly filled systems, such as pigment preparations and pigment pastes, where a high degree of particle stabilization is indispensable.</p><!-- more --><p>Purely electrostatic stabilization is not sufficient to stabilize highly concentrated pigment preparations and pigment pastes in such a way that they do not exhibit flocculation and segregation states during storage and processing.</p><p>For this reason, highly filled systems are stabilized either purely sterically or in a certain ratio of electrostatic and steric stabilization. Stabilization with electrostatic and steric components is referred to as electro-steric stabilization.</p><p>Illustration of the measurement setup<br><img src="https://analytik.news/en/grafik/papers/1131_1.jpg" alt="Fig.1: Illustration of the measurement setup"><br>Fig.1: Illustration of the measurement setup<br>(a) ESA probe, (b) measurement chamber,<br>(c) mechanical stirrer, (d) pipette,<br>(e) dispersion, (f) pH probe and<br>(g) conductivity probe. [Source:<br>“Electroacoustic Quantification of Surface<br>Bound Ligands in Functionalized Silica and<br>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles”, Whiley Publishers]<br>By adjusting the ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization, it may be possible to adjust the viscosity properties of the products. To maintain structural viscosity properties, as is often required in the field of paints and coatings, electrostatic stabilization is often necessary. For viscosities that should be independent of the shear rate (Newtonian viscosity behavior), purely steric stabilization may be useful.</p><p>The electroacoustic ESA measuring technique used is used to record the stabilization process during the addition of additives to an aqueous TiO2 pigment preparation (Figure 1). The measured data show the level and type of stabilization as a function of the added additive concentration. By using the ESA method, additive concentrations can be determined which lead to defined electro-steric or steric stabilization ratios. These dispersion states, which are now known, can then be transferred to the formulation development or formulation optimization of a pigment preparation.</p><p>In summary, the following advantages result from the use of the ESA measuring technique for recording a stabilization process through the addition of additives:</p><ul><li>Assignment of quantitative stability states to the added additive quantities.</li><li>Exact adjustment of electro-steric or pure steric stabilization states.</li><li>Avoidance of additive excess by detection of the complete surface coverage with the surface affine additive groups.</li><li>Estimation of the polymer layer thickness applied to the particles by the electrical double layer.</li><li>Control of dispersion products after storage or in production.</li><li>Evaluation of the ESA raw data signal enables measurement and evaluation without knowledge of the physical substance data.

The wetting and coating of the TiO2 pigment surfaces with the additive polymer leads to a decrease in the zeta potential, which is also a measure of the thickness of the applied polymer layer. The ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization can be detected and thus precisely adjusted.</p><p>zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment<br>Fig.2: Recording of the decrease of the zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment during additive addition.

The results show that the recommended additive concentrations of the additive manufacturers are good guidelines, but that the surface chemistry of the titanium dioxide pigments can vary so much due to post-treatment processes and manufacturing methods that for many TiO2-pigment grades a precise adjustment of the formulation is necessary. This is especially true when highly filled systems are manufactured at the maximum possible concentration, as is the case with pigment formulations and pigment pastes.<br>Conclusion<br>The ESA technique used in the present experiments has been elaborated in a particular way for different applications.</p><p>In the technical production process, dispersions are usually highly concentrated, turbid, colored or tempered. They are often electrostatically influenced by added additive formulations. Often the sedimentation of the mixture in the reactor must be prevented by powerful agitators. Stability analysis by means of electrokinetic sonic amplitude includes all parameters. Thus, the data of the samples analyzed in highly concentrated form can be directly transferred to the electrokinetic properties of the dispersed particles in the raw material or in the finished product.</p><p>By controlled recording of the stabilization process, it was possible to develop a stable semi-finished product with TINOX R-2140 as a pigment preparation with 78% TiO2 for aqueous dip coating applications, which showed no tendency to agglomeration even during subsequent strong dilution processes. The stabilization process could be deciphered a bit further and the dispersion states can be checked by means of ESA technology for process and quality control (see illustration Figure 4).</p><p>metrological recording of stabilization prozess<br>Fig.4: Illustration of the metrological recording of the stabilization process.<br><img src="https://analytik.news/en/grafik/papers/1131_4.jpg" alt="Illustration of the metrological recording of the stabilization process."></p><p>Information on the measurement method used<br>From a scientific point of view, the use of the ESA measurement technique is a method for direct quantification of accessible hydroxide groups on the surface of particles and a profound way for surface quantification of different ligands. While electrophoretic methods for zeta potential surface characterization for technical applications are limited by too high dilutions, sedimentation processes, irregular particle shape or inaccessible physical substance data, the ESA method is a complementary measurement technique for analysis in technical applications.</p><p>The ESA method for characterizing the charge stability of particles in a dispersion is an electroacoustic measurement technique.</p><p>An oscillating voltage is applied to a suspension, dispersion or emulsion, which is generated by an alternating current source. Charged particles in the dispersion oscillate at the frequency of the externally applied electric field. One or more frequencies can be applied. The oscillation of the particles at these frequencies generates sonic waves. The amplitudes of these sonic waves are measured as electrokinetic sonic amplitude (ESA). This ESA signal is proportional to the dynamic mobility of the particles and this in turn is proportional to the zeta potential of the particles present in the dispersion. A prerequisite for the use of this effect is a certain density difference between dispersion medium and particle. To generate evaluable signals, this density difference must be at least 0.2 g/cm3.</p>]]></content>
