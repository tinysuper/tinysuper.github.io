EUROPE CONTRACT PRICETable-EUROPE CONTRACT PRICE Price range One year ago US CTS/lb FD NWE Q4 EUR/kg +0.20 3-3.30 +0.20 2.20-2.65 54.48-168.83 Overview Upward momentum extends into Q1 on various factors Domestic supply remains constrained; imports uncompetitive, disrupted Demand mixed depending on end sector The bullish momentum in the European titanium dioxide (TiO2) market is extending into Q1 2022 - amid already record\u0002high prices - on low TiO2 stock levels in Europe, which are likely to be further compounded by a lack of Asian importcompetitiveness, seasonal preparations and healthy demand growth estimates for next year.Greater domestic over import sourcing for various reasons and feedstock supply strain, along with production issues -including Tronox’s force majeures at its Botlek and Stallingborough sites - continue to keep supply tense in Europe.Demand remains varied, depending on end sector.Europe TiO2 contract prices have trended up throughout 2021, hitting two record highs consecutively in Q3 and Q42021, driven by the market imbalance.Outlook Output cuts in China during the Olympics, logistic issues could impact exports in Q1 2022 Demand forecasts bullish for 2022 into certain industrial, wind segments Construction sector faces high backlogs vs other product shortages, inflationary pressures DIY demand in 2022 will depend on consumer spend options, pandemic circumstances Pent-up new auto demand could materialise in H2 2022 if microchips become more available PricesTriple-digit price increases have been separately announced in the European TiO2 market for western product for Q1 dueto low inventories, which could be further impacted by seasonal preparations and the continued lack of Asian importcompetitiveness. Feedstock supply tension and rising costs for feedstocks and energy are other considerations.Discussions are just getting underway. Room to negotiate is likely to be limited due to low TiO2 stocks in Europe.Although there are certain downstream players who have built some stocks during the low season, which could providesome moderating effect.Supply remains tight, with volumes continuing to be allocated. This is linked to the cumulative effects of robust demandin some segments and greater domestic sourcing over a prolonged period, driven by the uncompetitive and disruptedAsian import flow.Production issues and feedstock supply tension were also continuing to cap availability.Although, one trader suggested that sulphate TiO2 may not be as tight as chloride TiO2, because sulphate TiO2 istypically more affected by the low season.While there have been some price concessions heard for spot exports from Asia for sulphate TiO2 in order to reducestocks during the low season, this was not compensating for the unfavourable exchange-rate factors and high freightcosts, according to a trader, who said its chloride TiO2 export prices remain stable.China spot indications/deals done as follows: €3,300-3,600/tonne DDP (sulphate TiO2 standard paints and coatings grade) €3,400-3,800/tonne DDP (chloride TiO2 standard paints and coatings grade) Paper laminate demand for furniture remains robust in Q4 2021 and into Q1 2022, with order books full. Concerns aboutthe pandemic resurgence and new Omicron variant, along with cost escalation, have not impacted buying activity in thissegment so far.However, other sectors such as do-it-yourself (DIY), construction and auto have seen differing impacts from seasonalityand/or other product shortages. In the construction sector, seasonal factors are also being weighed against highbacklogs.The DIY sector has also seen some normalisation in H2 2021, following the pandemic lockdown peaks during 2020 andH1 2021.

However, this wasonly limited to material produced in Europe and sold in North America (see Prices).Price increase nominations in Europe emerged several weeks ago, and there have been ongoing discussions. EuropeanQ1 2022 proposals have been higher than in previous quarters for several reasons, including higher fuel costs. Althoughnatural gas prices in the US rose until late November as well, it was not to the magnitude seen in Europe.Also natural gas prices in the US declined steeply in the past week, following news of the Omicron variant of thecoronavirus in South Africa and other countries.There is concern about the impact of the variant on future production at Richard’s Bay Minerals, a company that isalmost 75% owned by Rio Tinto and located in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.Price increase proposals in the US have not been as widespread through November and the first days of December.The price chart below shows TiO2 contract pricing over the past year. Outlook Rising coronavirus cases from Omicron variant raise concern in ore feedstocks North America price increase nominations expected Q1 2022 supply &amp; demand conditions expected to be comparable to Q4 2021 PricesContracts for Q4 rose in late October, as producers were able to implement price increases with limited pushback due totight supply and strong demand.The coronavirus situation in South Africa is being monitored closely, as cases have begun to spike in the past week dueto the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The epicenter of the variant is the Gauteng province of South Africa, which isalso beginning to see a rise in hospitalisations.Richards Bay Minerals, a joint venture with majority ownership from Rio Tinto, is a key site for TiO2 feedstocks such asilmenite and rutile ores. It is located in KwaZulu-Natal, which has not yet seen a comparable uptick, in the early days ofthe variant.Operations were suspended in July and much of August because of civil unrest, the destruction of equipment, and thekilling of a manager but have resumed since late August.

With domestic buying slow,producers were looking more to the export market and it showed in higher Chinese export figures in October.While the Chinese domestic market was subdued, there was however a positive news. In November, the PurchasingManager Index (PMI) of China’s manufacturing industry was 50.1 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statisticsof China. It was 0.9 percentage point higher than October and pushed the index above the threshold of 50. That signalsan expansion.Elsewhere, some market participants said freight cost from December has risen and end-users were potentially lookingat higher offers on a CFR basis. Some buyers think if certain producers have inventory pressure, they could help absorbsome of the cost by lowering the FOB prices moving forward.Demand was present in Asia with buyers stating that they have either bought previously or planning to enter the spotmarket very soon. Sellers mostly did not see any change to the supply situation. They think the spot market should berelatively quiet for the rest of the year.There were still mixed views on how Chinese production would be impacted in January and market players wereunsurprisingly eager to find out more before making plans in the spot market. Many thinks the situation should clear upin H2 December. Outlook Market waiting for clearer indications on January production Some spot interest expected in Asia Q1 contract talks to gather pace PricesSelling indications were mostly around the $3,100/tonne FOB China level.

EUROPE CONTRACT PRICETable-EUROPE CONTRACT PRICE Price range One year ago US CTS/lb FD NWE Q3 EUR/kg +0.15 2.80-3.18 +0.20 2.20-2.65 148.79-168.98 Overview Sentiment firmer for Q4 Europe supply continues to face various pulls Buying momentum strong in construction, furniture segments Europe titanium dioxide (TiO2) contract price discussions are heard atypically firmer for Q4 - contrary to usual low season expectations during the winter - as domestic demand continues to exceed supply, compounded by the disrupted and uncompetitive Chinese import flow. Feedstock supply strain and recent and current TiO2 output disruptions have also impacted availability. Outlook Winter weather could impact construction in Q4; backlogs, supply concerns could offset this Supply tightness to persist amid various pulls Upstream supply tension could last at least for next few years PricesEurope TiO2 price increases of €120-150/tonne and up to €200-250/tonne for Q4 have been heard separately mooted by western suppliers amid a tight and buoyant market, which faces various persistent pulls on supply, including an ongoing lack of Chinese export competitiveness. Discussions are underway.Fresh buying interest for Asian spot cargo was limited in the trade sector this week, although logistical bottlenecks and the strict carbon controls on production/supply in China were being closely monitored.Supply remains tense, with allocations still in place for western product and no option to secure volumes outside of this. Lead times have been extended, especially for Chinese import product, because of the ongoing deep-sea logistics crisis. The lack of Chinese import competitiveness, stricter Chinese energy-saving measures and heightened shipping uncertainty are triggering more domestic over Asian import sourcing. Other import volumes are also believed to be significantly delayed, further pressuring European supply.Demand in Europe remains robust overall and continues to outpace supply. The construction and furniture segments continue to perform strongly. While there may be some seasonal slowdown in the construction segment in Q4 during the winter - depending on the weather conditions - this could be offset by backlog orders and supply concerns, which could support continued buying activity.Demand from the advertising sector is good, as events have re-opened as coronavirus restrictions have eased. While various product shortages such as microchips, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or additives may be capping demand for TiO2 in some sectors such as auto, this is not having an impact on overall TiO2 demand so far. Strained feedstock supply and a few TiO2 output impacts, including Tronox’s force majeure at Stallingborough, are also limiting TiO2 availability. ProductionThere is ongoing market talk that Tronox may still be experiencing production and supply disruption, although the company has not provided any comment on this at the time of writing. Tronox declared a force majeure on its TiO2 supply from its Stallingborough site in mid-July, due to production impacts.There is no further official update available on the status of Rio Tinto’s ramp-up/operations or force majeure at its Richards Bay Mineral (RBM) mine in South Africa, which restarted on 24 August following some forced downtime, linked to local tensions.

The separate price increase proposals were in the range of 7-8 cents/lb, with early October implementation dates.Potential price increase talks have picked up in recent weeks, and several agreements for Q4 have been heard. However, this reflects only a segment of the marketplace and discussions are ongoing.Thus far, some players commented that there was pushback from buyers on the proposed price increases, but there were limits on their leverage due to strong demand. Supply is still constrained in the US, especially for buyers on the spot market, as well as for contract buyers seeking to buy beyond their allocations. Outlook Demand expected to stay strong into Q4 Iluka expected to suspend operations in Sierra Leone in two months Private equity offer for Tronox to be monitored PricesThe price chart below shows US quarterly contract pricing over the past year. Price Increase AnnouncementsThis week, two more price increase nominations for Q4 were heard although they could not be fully verified.Thus far separate price increase proposals from Kronos and Tronox have been seen although the companies did not provide comment on the initiatives.Demand remains strong for TiO2 because of changing consumption patterns that have led to an increase in the usage of white pigment. This includes greater demand from end users making bathtubs, showers, and boats.Due to both stronger demand and supply constraints, buyers are seeking to procure material beyond their contractual allocations, which is leading to greater spot market activity. However, spot market prices have been heard to be 30-40 cents/lb higher than contracts in some instances.However, transactions at these higher levels have been heard because demand has been strong enough to support it.The announcements in the table below are for TiO2 produced through the chloride process.

Overview Spot talks in Asia limited Buyers unlikely to enter the market for rest of September Tight vessel space hampers cargo movement Spot talks were limited in the week in Asia, but buyers surveyed said they have requirements moving forward. Many said it was unlikely for them to enter the spot market in September and saw H2 October as a more likely time to buy cargoes.In the near term, on the demand side, the impact of Evergrande’s situation has affected sentiments in the market. Products that are directly linked to the construction industry could see demand impacted, but it is still not entirely clear at the moment for titanium dioxide (TiO2).On the export front, there were also some uncertainties in Asia where countries are in different phases in their fight against the coronavirus. In India, some buyers were undecided between stocking up or keeping inventories low with the festive season approaching, amid uncertainties over the coronavirus situation, even as vaccination rates have increased since May during the last major outbreak.On the supply front, checks on Chinese plants on their energy consumption can potentially impact run rates and supply. With both supply and demand in China facing uncertainties and Asian demand largely dependent on the individual country’s policy on reopening, many market players are expected to take a more short-term approach in the spot market. Outlook Asian buyers could enter market after China’s Golden Week holiday Chinese domestic demand could enter a lull in Q4 Supply could be impacted by various environmental checks PricesThere were selling indications at $3,100-3,200/tonne FOB China in the week. One deal was heard at $3,200/tonne FOB China for a 100-200 tonne cargo. Loading was said to be end September and early October. The deal was not considered in the assessment as it was outside the time frame stipulated in the ICIS methodology. Buyers polled were not in the market during the week, but buying indications were at around $3,050/tonne FOB China. Contract price for AsiaThere were no deals heard done. Discussions in certain parts of Asia could potentially drag into H1 October at least as firm talks have not started. One trader said with supply tight, buyers may have to bid quite close to the offer level in order to secure cargoes.

Australian titanium concentrate rarely flows into China again.Kenya’s output began to decrease in 2019. Further reduction in 2020.It can be seen that in recent years, foreign high-quality titanium slag has entered the Chinese market with a decreasing trend year by year. At the same time, Kenya Base Resources expects that for the 21st fiscal year, the output from July to June 2020 will be only 270,000 tons.It will further reduce the entry of foreign high-quality titanium slag into the Chinese market, especially the high-titanium slag materials suitable for the chloride process will further reduce the entry into the Chinese market. China domestic sistuationPanxi Region Abstract:Panxi Vanadium-titanium Magnetite Mine: Located in the southwest of Sichuan Province, it includes more than 20 counties and cities including Panzhihua and Liangshan Prefecture. The Panxi area is a huge titanium cornucopia. Its proven reserves of titanium resources are 1/4 of the world’s. It is accompanied by a dozen rare and precious metals such as vanadium, titanium, cobalt, and gallium. The proven vanadium-titanium magnetite is about 9.8×109 t, and the titanium dioxide reserves are 8.73×108 t. Average grade TiO2 content of slag 5%. Panxi Region 2020 Production reportIt is estimated that the actual production of titanium slag in Panxi area in 2020 will be about 3.5-3.6 million tons, and the output will be reduced by about 150,000 to 200,000 tons compared with 2019. As the nature of titanium slag in Panxi area is only suitable for sulfuric acid titanium dioxide production, Panxi The trend of regional titanium slag will directly affect the trend of the domestic titanium dioxide market. The actual output of Panzhihua Iron and Steel’s contract processing plant continued to decline due to the further tension of raw slag. The raw slag in 2021 will remain highly tight. In 2020, the production of Xichang Taihe was not very smooth due to maintenance and other reasons, which directly affected the supply of about 100,000-120,000 tons. Panzhihua Iron and Steel’s tailings pond relocation, due to potential safety hazards in Panzhihua’s original tailings pond, Pangang will temporarily transition to Fengyuan tailings pond, which will cause tailings emissions from nearby titanium slag producers. The surrounding titanium slag producers have caused a very large impact, which may cause the surrounding producers to further reduce production. In 2021, Lomon Billions Group’s Panzhihua 500,000-ton high-titanium slag project is expected to be officially put into operation in May, which will further cause a shortage of Panzhihua titanium slag supply. There will be no new titanium slag production capacity in Panxi area in 2021. Due to the further reduction in slag supply, it is expected that the supply of titanium slag will be further reduced in 2021, and it is expected that titanium slag price will maintain a high level trend. Due to the newly added titanium slag projects, including the Lonmon Billions Group’s high-titanium slag project, the amount of titanium slag required for the new production capacity of other titanium dioxide, it is expected that in 2021 there will be about 630,000 tons of titanium slag gap which will force titanium dioxide factories to turn to imported titanium slag. Therefore, it is expected that the entire titanium slag market, including the imported titanium slag market, will maintain a high degree of tight supply in 2021, and the price will continue to run at a high level, without a very obvious price downward signal. Other titanium related industry briefIn 2020, the domestic titanium sponge market will be completely different from the international market. Foreign related industries such as titanium sponge and titanium materials will be in a downturn. The domestic market expects that the output of titanium sponge will reach 100,000 tons. The market began to appear in June. Continued price increases have stimulated the rise in the titanium tetrachloride market.In 2020, the welding electrode industry and the reduced titanium industry will basically maintain the same market conditions as in 2019, and there will be no major changes. However, there will be new suppliers of artificial rutile, and production will be gradually released, such as the 100,000-ton artificial rutile project in Guangdong Maoming Yueqiao. Future Outlook of Titanium Industry The domestic market of titanium dioxide will remain cautiously optimistic. It is expected that the supply will ease in April 2021, but the production cost will remain high. The titanium dioxide market segment will gradually increase. For example, Huiyun Titanium Industry will invest in a new plastic-specific titanium dioxide production line (currently no more public information) The construction of chlorinated titanium dioxide will enter a period of rapid expansion. For example, Dinglong Culture will invest in new 500,000 tons of chlorinated titanium dioxide (the specific implementation details are not announced in the announcement) Domestic titanium dioxide suppliers will further prepare their export plans and continue to increase their export shares to ensure the operation of their factories. If no more titanium dioxide applications are developed in the next 2-3 years, the domestic titanium dioxide market will have very large industry competition. Imported titanium slag will maintain the current situation without significant increase and substantial reduction, but in the long run, high-quality imported titanium slag will still further decrease. The slag supply in Panzhihua area and the influence of Panzhihua Iron and Steel Tailings Pond will continue to operate at a higher price in the next 1-2 years. The estimated price range is 230usd/ton—305usd/ton. Overall, the supply in Panxi will remain tight in the next 2-3 years, mainly due to the increase in the amount of titanium slag required for the production of new titanium dioxide and the gradual decrease in the supply of raw slag. It is difficult to change within.

It is also suspected of discharging sewage to the nearby Dasha River and piling up solid waste on the riverbed. Serious damage to the local ecological environment, affecting the normal life of the villagers.” On December 9, a villager in Hekou Village, Longxiang Sub-district Office, Zhongzhan District, Jiaozuo City, Henan Province said angrily to a reporter from China Business News. Located in the western industrial agglomeration area of Jiaozuo, Henan, Longmangbaili is a large-scale inorganic fine chemical group, mainly engaged in the production and sales of titanium dioxide, titanium sponge, zirconium products and sulfuric acid. It is the largest titanium dioxide enterprise in Asia. For many years, the company’s industrial solid waste has been buried in Hekou Village, Liuzhuang Village, Sihou Village, etc. Due to the proximity to the village, local villagers questioned the environmental protection and safety of the project. In response to the above question, the Lomon Billion person did not respond to the reporter. They stated that the interview can be linked to the local government propaganda department, and the company does not respond. “As the largest enterprise in the city, Lomonblade absolutely meets the environmental protection standards, and there will be no violations.” An official from the Zhongzhan District Ecological Environment Bureau told reporters that the industrial solid waste “yellow mud” procedures are complete, and the waste water has been since 2012. It has been discharged to the pollution treatment plant in the Zhongzhan District, with online monitoring. However, as of press time, the person has not provided reporters with the Lomon Billion project environmental assessment and other regulatory documents. Discharging waste to the “Mother River”? Hekou Village is located at the foot of Taihang Mountain. In recent years, the rapid development of industry has disrupted the originally peaceful village life. The villagers of Hekou Village told reporters that Lomon Billion is close to the east side of the village, and every day a large amount of industrial waste and wastewater are buried and discharged, which may cause the soil and groundwater in the village to be polluted. On the east side, there was a ravine hundreds of meters deep, but it has long been filled with industrial waste. Originated from the Dasha River in the depths of the Taihang Mountains, known as the “Mother River” of Jiaozuo, it passes by the west side of Hekou Village. Villagers told reporters that Lomon Billion was suspected of discharging wastewater into Hanoi for many years. When the reporter found the sewage outlet of Lomon Billion to Dasha River that the villagers were referring to, there was still suspected waste water discharged from the sewage outlet. At the same time, the artificially dug ditches extended to the Dasha River, and the ditches accumulated a layer of yellowish-brown unidentified objects. Regarding the issue of wastewater discharge raised by the villagers, the reporter reported to the Zhongzhan District Ecological Environment Bureau and provided corresponding videos and photos. A person from the Central Station District Ecological Environment Bureau told reporters that the sewage outlet was previously used by Lomon Billion. After the construction of the sewage treatment plant in the middle station area in 2012, the company had already sealed the outlet. The person emphasized that it is impossible to say that it was Lomon Billion’s discharge at this time, and conclusions can only be drawn after investigation. A person in the titanium dioxide industry told reporters that the unknown matter in the river ditch was yellowish brown, which may be caused by the titanium dioxide wastewater containing iron ions. It is reported that the wastewater discharged from the production of titanium dioxide will contain substances such as sulfate and ferrous sulfate. The reporter learned that there is only one titanium dioxide company near Dasha River. Its capacity is mainly to produce titanium dioxide by the sulfuric acid process. As we all know, the sulfuric acid process has environmental pollution risks and high treatment costs. This is also an important reason for the development of the chlorination process by Lomon Billion in recent years. In addition, the villagers of Hekou Village told reporters that because solid waste filled the ravines, some companies started dumping industrial waste into the riverbed. The reporter saw at the scene that there was a pile of yellow mound not far from the sewage outlet on the wide river bed, and yellow-brown waste water could still be seen next to the mound. The reporter saw at the scene that Longmangbaili was built with its back on the mountain, Liuzhuang Village of Longxiang Sub-district Office in Zhongzhan District is located behind the mountain, and Sihou Village is on the east. According to villagers in Liuzhuang Village, Lomon Billion is on the mountain. The reporter saw trucks dumping solid waste into the valley at the top of the mountain, accompanied by white smoke. Local villagers said that the area from the south of the village to the foot of the mountain has been buried and covered with loess. Now landfill in the ravine on the north side of the village. During the reporter’s investigation, they saw trucks full of industrial solid waste driving north through the village. At the same time, there is also a buried ravine across the road on the south side of Sihou Village, which has been replanted in accordance with the policy. However, the reporter found on the top of the mountain above the ravine that industrial solid waste was still buried on it, overgrown with weeds, and yellow-brown industrial solid waste and a small amount of wastewater could be seen. Is the procedure missing? Regarding the above-mentioned villagers’ reports of Lomon Billion’s suspected pollution discharge and landfilling of solid waste, the reporter asked the Zhongzhan District Ecological Environment Bureau to verify whether they could provide the company’s relevant environmental assessment procedures and other documents. A source from the department told reporters that during the EIA procedures of Lomon Billion, the key was taken away due to a business trip by a colleague in the management materials room. It takes 4 days to come back and the colleague will provide it when he returns. In addition, the reporter asked the person to lead the people from the Ecological Environment Bureau to the Dasha River sewage outlet reported by the villagers. It said “no need” and said, “We all know the place and will check it out by ourselves, and will reply together at that time.” But as of press time, the department has not responded to reporters further, nor provided relevant EIA documents. If the EIA procedures are complete, why can’t it come out? A person from the Propaganda Department of the Zhongzhan District told reporters that the Ecology and Environment Bureau and the enterprises do not provide EIA materials because of too much pressure and fear of problems. It is understood that Lomon Billion is the largest local enterprise and a major taxpayer in the region. Public information shows that in 2017 and 2019, local media reported on the suspected discharge of waste water to Dasha River by the local media, and also reported to the local Ecology and Environment Bureau, but the feedback effect does not seem to be optimistic. An environmental law enforcement official told reporters that the wastewater problem is actually very easy to deal with. First, check the on-site inspection of wastewater to trace the root cause, and then find the company to check whether the water and drainage volume matches the capacity. If the amount of sewage discharged for so many years is very large, the comparative data is clear at a glance. The environmental impact assessment will have relevant regulations on drainage issues. An enterprise can only have one sewage outlet. If the enterprise discharges to a centralized sewage treatment plant, there will be no other sewage outlet. Economist Song Qinghui told reporters that in fact, some polluting enterprises are the main pillars of local fiscal revenues. Some local governments, especially in economically underdeveloped areas, have “passed and passed” the pollution control enterprises, or practiced formalism, and are enjoying the increase in fiscal revenue. At the same time, villagers are allowed to bear the consequences of environmental pollution. Repeated violations were punished It is understood that the domestic titanium dioxide industry is dominated by the sulfuric acid process. The treatment of the “three wastes” is not difficult, but the treatment costs are high. The waste gas produced by the production of titanium dioxide is mainly acid mist and dust, etc., which can be effectively treated by spray washing and gravity sedimentation; the waste residue produced can be treated by techniques such as landfill and neutralization; ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, Waste acid, gypsum residue, etc. can be recycled or comprehensively utilized. “As the largest titanium dioxide company in China, if there is a large number of pollution problems, Lomon Billion will not only damage the ecological environment, but also seriously undermine fair competition in the industry.” Song Qinghui said in an interview with reporters. In fact, Lomonbali has repeatedly received “tickets” for environmental protection and safety issues in recent years. In 2019, Lomon Billion received the “Administrative Penalty Decision” issued by the Emergency Management Bureau of Jiaozuo City, Henan Province (Jiaoan Jianpu [2019] No. 72). The penalty decision letter shows that after the investigation of Jiaozuo City Emergency Management Bureau, the 1 million tons/year high-salt wastewater deep treatment project organized by Lomon Billion has been requested by Jiaozuo City Emergency Management Bureau to stop construction in the early stage, and no construction project has been obtained in the project. In the case of the safety review, the project is still under construction. Jiaozuo Emergency Management Bureau decided to fine Lomon Billion 1 million yuan. In addition, in 2019, Lomon Billion also received two “Administrative Penalty Decisions” issued by the Henan Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment. The “Administrative Penalty Decision” shows that Lomon Billions’ annual production line of sulfuric acid titanium dioxide production line with an annual output of 120,000 tons was put into production without environmental protection acceptance. In addition, the main project of the company’s annual production of 300,000 tons of sulfur-chlorine coupled titanium material green manufacturing project has been completed, power distribution facilities, electrical instrumentation systems and pipelines have not been completed, and the environmental impact assessment documents of the construction project have not been submitted according to law, and a fine of 400,000 yuan has been imposed , An administrative penalty of 1.3 million yuan. From 2017 to 2018, Lomon Titanium, a subsidiary of Lomon Billion Holdings, was punished by the local environmental protection department for 6 violations of laws and regulations. The penalties mainly involve solid waste, sewage, and waste gas treatment. Among them, on August 3, 2018, the Environmental Protection Bureau of Mianzhu City, Sichuan carried out a law enforcement inspection on Lomon Titanium, and found that Lomon Titanium had 5000 cubic meters of leachate collection tank overflowing wastewater discharged without treatment when it rained at night. The monitoring report issued by the Deyang Environmental Monitoring Center Station showed that the pollutant indicators in the spilled wastewater exceeded the “Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard.” On March 30, 2017, Deyang City Environmental Monitoring Center Station conducted monitoring results of Lomon Titanium Industry. It was shown that the pH value of the effluent wastewater exceeded the national standard due to the malfunction of the pH alarm. Lomon Titanium Industry was fined 671,600 yuan. Song Qinghui told reporters that Lomon Billion’s large number of environmental penalties indicate that the company has “loopholes” in its management. Since its listing in 2011, Lomon Billion has adhered to the development model of two-wheel drive of merger expansion and endogenous growth. It acquired Sichuan Lomon Titanium Industry Co., Ltd. in 2016 and Yunnan Metallurgical Xinli Titanium Industry Co., Ltd. in 2019. Formed an operation and management model centered on the group headquarters and coordinated with the six production bases. In this regard, the development goal of deep integration between Lomon Billion and its subsidiaries has put forward higher requirements to the group’s management. Lomon Billion also said that the macroeconomic environment is becoming increasingly complex and changeable. If the company cannot continue to improve its management and decision-making efficiency, it may have a certain impact on the company’s normal production and operation.","link":"/2020/12/30/Asia-s-largest-titanium-dioxide-manufacture-is-trapped-in-an-environmental-vortex-Lomon-Billions-has-been-accused-of-sewage-for-many-years/"},{"title":"Analysis of China&#39;s titanium dioxide and titanium ore market in April 2020 and market forecast for May","text":"After the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the entire industry market has undergone strong changes. The domestic construction industry is basically still in the unopened state, which directly and indirectly causes the demand for coatings and titanium dioxide to be greatly reduced, and domestic sales are basically very difficult.Due to the outbreak of foreign epidemics, basically all countries have adopted measures to close the country to prevent the epidemic from further out of control. Therefore, overseas sales of titanium dioxide are basically at a standstill. As a result, the domestic sales of titanium dioxide in April were not very optimistic, especially the price of titanium dioxide in the first-tier domestic manufacturers fell sharply in April, and the market price was in chaos. At the same time, the latest price is already close to its cost price. Will stay for a long time. But on the other hand, many domestic factories have begun to fully restore their production capacity. It is expected that the actual output of titanium dioxide factories will reach a higher level in May. At the same time, it is expected that the price of titanium dioxide will steadily decrease partly, not as large as in April. Adjust the price by a margin. In addition, due to the gradual control of the domestic epidemic situation, the resumption of production and production in various industries will continue to improve, and the sales of titanium dioxide will gradually rebound. In 2020, the titanium ore market rose directly from 1400 yuan at the beginning of the year to 1550-1600 yuan. The main reason is that the purchase volume of titanium ore has increased significantly. Due to the very tight purchase of ore, the supply of raw materials for medium ore is very tight, which has pushed up the price of medium ore. Titanium suppliers’ reluctance to sell gradually increased from January 2020 to the end of February to 1550-1600 yuan, and then the willingness of titanium dioxide factories to purchase titanium ore was gradually lowered due to the impact of the epidemic, resulting in the gradual price of titanium ore in Panzhihua region. Down, the 10 mines in the Panzhihua area as of April 27, 2020 have fallen to around 1,350 yuan.It is expected that the titanium ore market in May will stabilize with the changes in the titanium dioxide market, and prices will not be adjusted significantly, and the balance of supply and demand for titanium ore will be further stabilized. At the same time, imported titanium ore, especially high-grade titanium ore, will maintain the current price. Due to various reasons, imported high-grade titanium ore will not undergo major price changes due to the epidemic situation. The supply of imported titanium ore is relatively comparative tension.","link":"/2020/04/27/Analysis-of-China-s-titanium-dioxide-and-titanium-ore-market-in-April-2020-and-market-forecast-for-May/"},{"title":"CHTI: The joint venture company plans to invest 10 billion yuan in new energy power generation projects","text":"On the evening of September 17, CHTI issued an announcement that its subsidiary Baiyin China Nuclear Times New Energy Co., Ltd. and the Baiyin Municipal People’s Government signed a new energy power generation project investment framework agreement.

Among them, the market price of Lonmong Billions announced a total of 4 times price increase, respectively on February 12, March 7, August 15, and September 3. The declines were in January, July, and November.After entering December, due to the suspension of operation of Richards Bay in South Africa, the situation of raw materials is further strained. At the same time, due to the increasing cost of titanium raw materials manufacturers in China, titanium dioxide manufacturers have to consider whether to conduct price increases or halt for maintenance. At present, Most manufacturers have chosen the former and announced price increases ranging from 30-50 usd/ton to offset the cost pressure brought by the continuous price increase of titanium raw materials.In January 2020, due to the traditional Chinese New Year holiday, China’s titanium dioxide market is expected to maintain the current price increase trend. At the same time, the titanium dioxide supply may be in short and tight in general. It is expected that large-scale price increases will occur in February. At the same time, due to the influence of titanium raw materials, the production cost of chlorinated titanium dioxide will be greatly increased, and the supply of high-quality titanium ore and high slag will continue to be tight.

The top three import countries in the first half of 2020 are Mozambique, Australia, and Kenya, accounting for 37%, 15%, and 11% of total imports, respectively. Through the analysis of titanium slag import data, it can be seen that Kenya’s titanium slag output has further declined, and will maintain a certain decline in the future. At the same time, the import volume of Ukraine and Australia has gradually increased, indicating that Australia is importing more and more titanium slag into China for processing. Norwegian titanium slag imports have gradually increased, indicating that with the further integration and concentration of high-titanium slag plants, certain changes have taken place in the global high-titanium slag market. In the future, the titanium raw material market will gradually shift the focus of competition to the Chinese market.In particular, the competition for raw materials such as high-quality high-titanium slag and artificial rutile suitable for the production of titanium dioxide by the chloride process will further intensify.

This follows an expert hearing (CARACAL) in September in which several EU Member States rejected the classification of titanium dioxide as a carcinogenic. In addition to being classified in category 2 as substance “suspected of causing cancer in humans”, the pigment is added to the list of substances under the Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP). Thus, titanium dioxide placed on the market in powder form would have to be labelled as carcinogenic. The classification would also apply to powdered mixtures containing titanium dioxide particles. Liquid mixtures, including coatings, paints and printing inks, should include a warning on their packaging regarding spray applications. If no objection is lodged by the Council or the European Parliament within the next two months, the classification will become valid after a transitional period of 18 months, i.e. probably from summer 2021 on. The classification meets with strong criticism from the coatings and printing ink industry.

Undesired interactions between the polymer and pigment can be suppressed and, above all, the demands on shear forces in the dispersion process are reduced. This leads to maximum optical properties and the most efficient use in the plastic end product.Inorganic post-treatments are mainly carried out to improve certain properties of the end product and also improve the dispersion properties.

Theapplied inorganic aluminum post-treatment also contributes to this.” The general qualitative statement that a TiO2 pigment is provided with inorganic and organic post-treatment is notsufficient to derive excellent process capability in the extrusion process.Organic post-treatment substances that have been applied to a high degree can separate from the TiO2-pigmentdespite conventional process temperatures and migrate to or near the surface of the pigmented plastic.

An Al2O3 posttreatment is compatible with all common binders and is unproblematic from this point of view.Nevertheless, a portion of “crystal water” can outgas, especially at elevated process temperatures, wherebytechnically a portion of water vapor forms in the melt. For this reason, it is advantageous if plastics TiO2 gradeshave a not too high aluminum oxide post-treatment at process temperatures above 270 ° C. “TINOX R-2280 was developed taking into account all expected interface interactions.The low volatile components of TINOX R-2280, tested at high temperatures, clearly demonstrate the successfuloptimization with regard to the type and amount of post-treatment. The optimized aluminum post-treatment inparticular reduces the occurrence of “lacing” in the production of thin foils.” Extrusion process - energies required for dispersing “Polymers generally have relatively low surface energies. The organic post-treatment of TINOX R-2280 lowersthe surface energy of the pigment surface which improves the dispersibility in plastic applications.” Increased fine particle size of a pigment also requires higher dispersion energy input or longer residence times ofthe pigment in the shear zones. The higher number of agglomerates of small sizes requires a higher probability ofstaying in the dispersion process in order to completely disperse the TiO2 pigment and to fully utilize the performance of tinting strength and opacity. The use or the modified addition of effective process additives opens up possibilities for optimizing the dispersionprocess. However the effort of renewed evaluations and the control of the impact on further subsequent process steps and end products are good arguments that such activities are usually not the top priority. The energy input required for dispersion can be controlled via the process parameters speed of the extruder screw and the temperature curve along the extruder screw. Regardless of whether extrusion premix(1) or split-feeding(2) process, pigments are incorporated into a plastic melt in stirring screws of different temperature zones.Agglomerates are dispersed faster, the larger they are, the higher the shear rate and shear stress and the lower the agglomerate strength. The extrusion process runs with an increasing temperature gradient over the zones in which the materials aredrawn in, over into the zone of melting / plasticizing and finally into the homogenization zone in which the actualdispersion process takes place due to shear forces acting on the melt. The result of the dispersion is determined,among other things, by the input of the mechanical dispersion power. The local temperature and other processvariables such as the torque built up are control variables for the mechanical energy input. The viscosity of the melt can be controlled by the temperature gradient along the extrusion axis, high temperatures producing low viscosities of the plastic melt. As the screw speedincreases, the shear rate is the dominant influence on the deagglomeration of the pigment in the plastic melt. In contrast, lower temperatures in the extruder screw produce higher viscosities of the plastic melt, which leads to increased deagglomeration due to increasing shear stresses in the plastic melt leads.In this case, a higher torque is measured at constant screw speed. “The high optimized fine particle size of R-2280, which leads to the excellent bluish pigment properties, mayrequire an increased energy input into the extrusion process in certain applications. Increasing screw speedleads to a shorter residence time and thus to a reduction in the probability of agglomerates staying in the shearzones. For this reason, a slight reduction in the temperature in suitable zones of the screw can lead to improveddispersion due to higher viscosities of the plastic melt and the associated increasing shear stresses” SummaryTINOX R-2280 was developed taking into account all expected interface interactions.The low volatile components of TINOX R-2280, tested at high temperatures, clearly demonstrate the successfuloptimization with regard to the type and amount of post-treatment. In particular, the optimized aluminumpost-treatment of R-2280 reduces the occurrence of “lacing” in the production of thin foils.Fine TiO2-particles tend to agglomerate. If the TiO2 agglomerates are not dispersed in the plastic matrix, thepositive properties such as lightening capacity and opacity cannot develop fully. For this reason, the complete andhomogeneous dispersion of titanium dioxide pigment in plastics is an important task in the production ofTiO2-pigmented plastics.TINOX R-2280 is a rutile TiO2 pigment from the sulfate process which produces bluish optical properties in thepigmented plastic that are well above average. The bluish optical properties are generated by an optimized andfinely divided particle size distribution. Numerous variations within the screw configuration of the dispersion zonecan be carried out with relatively little effort and the influence of individual shear elements on the processvariables can be determined.An optimized and high fine particle size of TiO2 pigment particles, which leads for example to the excellent bluishpigment properties of R-2280, may require an increased energy input into the extrusion process in certainapplications. By control of screw speed and srew-temperature during the extrusion process the dispersion resultcan be controled Footnotes In the “premix process”, all raw materials are usually cold mixed using different mixing methods. In addition to cold mixing, the hot mixing process ispracticed, albeit more rarely. The premix is usually metered volumetrically via screw conveyors into the extruder feed. Due to the high pigmentconcentrations, the use of powdered polymer is common to ensure statistical particle distribution. In addition, granules take significantly longer tomelt in the extruders and, through pigment compaction in the feed area, increase the risk of irreversible agglomerates that can no longer be shreddedby shearing. In the “split feeding process”, the individual components are added to different extruder openings January 10th 2020Tinox Chemie GmbHEmanuel-Leutze-Str. 2140547 Düsseldorf，GermanyTel Nr. : +49(0)211 52809600Email : sale@tinoxchem.de","link":"/2020/01/22/Extrusion-process-using-TINOX%C2%AE-R-2280-TiO2-plastic-grade/"},{"title":"France to ban titanium dioxide whitener in food from 2020","text":"PARIS (Reuters) - France will ban the use of titanium dioxide as a food additive from 2020 after the country’s health and safety agency said there was not enough evidence to guarantee the safety of the substance. Titanium dioxide is widely used in industry as a whitener, notably for paint, and in the food sector, where it is labeled E171 and goes into products from chocolate to chewing gum. France had ordered a review of the substance in 2017 after a study found health effects in animals that consumed it. France’s National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) and partners in a study of oral exposure to titanium dioxide had shown that E171 crosses the intestine wall in animals to reach other parts of the body. Asked to do a wider review into the ingredient, health and safety agency ANSES found there was not enough evidence to prove it was safe for humans, the French economy and environment ministries said in a joint statement on Wednesday. “ANSES stresses in its opinion that the evaluation of the risks related to the use of this additive still suffers from a lack of data that the marketers and producers of this additive should have provided,” they said. “In particular, no acceptable daily intake could be established for this additive due to lack of data.” E171 is authorized at European Union level and the French government said it would notify the European Commission and other member states of its decision.","link":"/2019/10/14/France-to-ban-titanium-dioxide-whitener-in-food-from-2020/"},{"title":"How long could this energy limits policy from Chinese government last?","text":"You might be surprised, shocked or frustrated when you heard the news from your Chinese supplier about the energy limits movement now in vast China mainland, from east to west.Or you might thought this is just another trick that your supplier is making as a late delivery excuse.If you are, you might just underestimate this energy limits movement like I did days ago, like the local governors did months ago. BackgroundTo begin with, let us back to Sep.22 2020, the Seventy-fifth United Nations General Assembly, the Chinese leader announced that China will increase its national independent contribution, adopt more powerful policies and measures, strive to reach the peak of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.The carbon beutrality was set as an goal since then. Oct.13 2020, The Chinese energy importer and steel manufactures had received the notice from government to stop the coal importation from Australia. In 2019–20, China took a little over a third of Australia’s premium metallurgical coal exports and Australia supplied about 55% of China’s metallurgical coal imports.Since then, more and more people started to worry about the enerygy industry of China, cause the coal power taken 70% of total power supply of China. But this also showed the determination of China to achieve the carbon neutrality goal. June, 2021, The Chinese banned the crypto mining mostly due to the high energy consumption which may give big pressure to the power supply. China’s ban forces some bitcoin miners to flee overseas, others sell out Aug, 2021, China state planner vows crackdown on projects with high energy use(https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/china-state-planner-vows-crackdown-projects-with-high-energy-use-2021-08-17/).At that time, the manufactures should have been smelled the danger from their own government, but most of them choose to ignore under the protection of local governors. Cause the high energy use project is the pillar stone to the local GDP in some provinces as Jiangsu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Shandong, Guizhou etc. They might thought the central government will give them enough time to balance the GDP and the carbon neutrality. But the fact is, this time, they need to behave fastly.Just a month later, China to strike harder against regions that fail to curb energy use. Yunnan, 90% Yellow Phosphorus production was shutted down.Jiangsu, The operating rate of soda ash enterprises may drop by 20%Jiangsu, a major chemical province known as “Su Daqiang”, currently has 14 chemical parks and 15 chemical concentration areas. As of the end of December 2020, there are more than 2,000 chemical companies in Jiangsu Province. Guangdong: Suspend Energy Conservation Review of “Two Highs” ProjectGuangdong Province is a major paint province and a major chemical town. There are more than 2,000 local chemical companies. They are mainly famous in the national paint market for home decoration wood coatings and architectural coatings. The “Guangdong Province Energy Consumption Dual Control Work Plan for 2021” issued by the Guangdong Development and Reform Commission pointed out that focusing on the “two highs” industries such as steel, chemical, non-ferrous metals, cement, glass, etc., benchmarking international and domestic or industry advanced levels, and comprehensively carrying out energy conservation Diagnose and promote energy-saving transformation and green upgrading of production lines. Sichuan: Interview with red warning areas and put forward rectification requirementsSichuan Province has a relatively complete chemical industry system and a relatively concentrated layout. It is an important natural gas chemical production and research and development base in the country. The production capacity of fertilizers, melamine and other products ranks first in the country. There are more than 1,000 chemical companies in Sichuan Province and more than 200 coating companies. Panzhihua City, Sichuan Province, is the most concentrated area of titanium dioxide enterprises in the country. Taihai Technology, Tianlun Chemical, Titanium Chemical, Dahutong Titanium and other enterprises are all well-known titanium dioxide enterprises in the country. The Sichuan Provincial Leading Group on Climate Change has conducted an interview with the main government officials of the three cities (prefectures) of Guangyuan City, Ya’an City, and Aba Prefecture that have a red warning for the completion of the energy consumption “dual control” target in the first half of this year, and put forward rectification requirements . Insist on putting the dual control of energy consumption in a prominent position, and correctly handle the relationship between economic development and energy saving. It is necessary to keep a close eye on the dual control goals, take effective measures to reverse the passive situation as soon as possible, and go all out to complete this year’s energy dual control goals.….. What is the impact on TiO2 production in China.Lower factory operating rate. Produce 1tons of Sulphate process rutile tio2 need 5000-8000KWH electricity power. TiO2 industry is for sure the high energy use industry and the government limits on the power supply will for sure result in less output. This is not a matter of price anymore, it is lower outputs. Longer delivery period. Since Aug., the end users of TiO2 started their inneed purchase again to sustain their owen production. Even the south east asia market is totally locked down due to the Dealta Viruse, but the total needs is recovering. And the orders is recovering, but the production is shrinking, to get the materials it is taking longer. Higher price. All in all, all factors will requst in a higher price again. When will this chaos end? No one really knows, as to the Chinese government style, they will never give up till they get what they want. If the manufactures and the local governors can not make a plan to reduce the power use, it could be a long way to go.","link":"/2021/09/18/How-long-could-this-energy-limits-policy-from-Chinese-government-last/"},{"title":"Global titanium dioxide market outlook for the better","text":"Recently, a number of titanium dioxide manufacturers said that the global demand for titanium dioxide is strong and the supply is tight, and the market price may continue to rise. Major producers Chemours, Venator, Tronox and Kronos reported positive results in the first quarter and expect their performance to continue to grow for the rest of this year. Increase in sales and decrease in inventory“Chemours’ sales in the first quarter increased by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The demand for coatings, plastics and laminates in Chemours’ titanium technology business continued to increase in the second quarter.” Chemours President and CEO Mark P. Vergnano stated on the May 4 earnings conference call, “In the first half of this year, new houses and renovations in various countries are driving the rapid growth of demand for architectural coatings. Since 2020, the demand for DIY products has maintained a strong momentum.”John D. Romano from Tronox said that the sales volume of titanium dioxide in the first quarter increased by 15% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Demand in various regions was strong, but the largest growth was in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Simon Turner, chief executive officer of Venator, also said that market demand has unexpectedly grown strongly. All industries and regions have strong demand for functional titanium dioxide. The demand for specialty titanium dioxide products has shown a good momentum of recovery, mainly in the textile and automotive industries. Venator’s titanium dioxide sales volume has continuously increased by 14%. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, the device utilization rate has increased, and the inventory remains tight throughout the first quarter. Demand is back on trackThe overall demand for titanium dioxide has basically returned to the level before the epidemic. The Kronos report shows that sales in the first quarter of this year were 141,000 tons, an increase of 4% from 136,000 tons in the same period last year, and an increase of 14% from 124,000 tons in the second quarter of 2020. The total sales volume in the third quarter of last year was 136,000 tons and the fourth quarter was 135,000 tons. Other manufacturers did not report sales, but their year-on-year sales growth data showed the same trend. Chemours’ titanium dioxide sales in the first quarter of this year increased by 16% year-on-year, while the first quarter of 2020 increased by 19% year-on-year, and the second quarter of 2020 decreased by 9% year-on-year. Tronox’s sales in the first quarter of this year increased by 16% year-on-year, the first quarter of last year sales increased by 6% year-on-year, and the second quarter fell by 27% year-on-year. Venators’ sales volume of Titanium Dioxide in the first quarter of this year was down 1% year-on-year, and in the second quarter of 2020, it was down 21% year-on-year.Chemours Chief Operating Officer Mark Newman said: “The recovery in demand for titanium dioxide started when DIY products were launched in the second quarter of last year. Architectural coatings accounted for most of the company’s titanium dioxide business, and the rest was laminate and plastics business. Then there is the construction industry demand, especially the demand for new housing, which is growing rapidly. Based on the current development trend, sales are expected to increase in the next three quarters.” Supply tends to be tightAfter the collapse of demand in the second quarter of last year, titanium dioxide producers around the world have drastically reduced their production, and then the slow recovery of production has resulted in a tight supply situation. Newman said: “Judging from the operation of our factory in March and April, our production in the second quarter will be higher than that in the first quarter. In addition, in terms of the supply of each factory, the supply of raw materials is restricted, but these are all It’s only a temporary impact.” Venator also expressed a similar view.Although the price of titanium dioxide is rising in the first quarter of this year, it has not fully recovered. At the same time, production costs are also increasing. Hassan Ahmed, an analyst at Alembic Global Advisors, an American investment research company, predicts that the price of titanium dioxide will continue to push up this year. He pointed out in a recent research report: “The current titanium dioxide price is only slightly higher than the 16-year average level and the 2008-2009 crisis period, so the upward potential is greater.” The price of ilmentile continues to rise, which may further push the price of titanium dioxide increasing.Turner pointed out that China’s exports remained stable in the first quarter of this year, and the main export markets were other Asian countries and emerging markets. He said: “Due to the strong local demand for titanium dioxide in China, coupled with transportation restrictions, China’s exports to Europe and North America will fall, which will make customers more hope that we can provide reliable supplies.” Due to rising raw material and transportation costs, Chinese titanium dioxide producers are also continuously increasing their sales prices, thereby continuing to narrow the arbitrage space.According to relevant data, Chemours, Venator, Tronox and Kronox together account for 40% of the global titanium dioxide production capacity, with a total global production capacity of 8.4 million tons/year in 2020. Chemours has the largest production capacity, about 1.2 million tons/year; followed by Tronox with 1 million tons/year; Venator and Kronox both have 500,000 tons/year. In the past 10 years, China’s titanium dioxide production capacity has surged, from 2.1 million tons/year in 2011 to 3.7 million tons/year in 2020, accounting for 44% of the world’s total production capacity. During the same period, China’s annual net exports increased from 41,000 tons to 69,000 tons.","link":"/2021/06/23/Global-titanium-dioxide-market-outlook-for-the-better/"},{"title":"International rutile prices rose in the third quarter","text":"With the recovery in Europe and America, the demand for titanium raw materials by European and American companies is also recovering. It is understood that driven by the growth of demand in Europe and the United States, ILUKA’s rutile quotation in the third quarter rose from the previous US$1,495/ton to US$1,640/ton. In addition to ILUKA, some foreign companies have also raised the price of 95 rutile. At present, the international quotations of 95 rutiles are all above US$1,600/ton, and the supply exceeds demand. According to several rutile manufacturers, the current western downstream users are more active in purchasing rutile raw materials, and the spot supply of rutile is tight. In May, ILUKA announced that it would suspend the production of rutile mines in Sierra Leone after November this year, which will cause the global supply of rutile to drop by more than 140,000 tons per year. At the same time, the safety accident at Rio Tinto’s South Africa plant has made the plant’s future stability of high-titanium slag supply uncertain. If the output of ILUKA rutile is reduced while Rio Tinto’s South Africa titanium slag plant also sees a decline in output, then the global supply of high-grade titanium-rich materials at the end of this year will not be optimistic. Judging from the current situation, the market prices of high-titanium slag and rutile have been determined to rise slightly in the third quarter. If the supply situation of Rio Tinto’s South Africa plant does fluctuate at the end of this year, the global price of rutile and titanium slag may rise sharply again in the fourth quarter. Some industry insiders believe that the price of 95 rutile may exceed US$1,800/ton by then. According to relevant analysis, customers in the welding consumables industry may be the most affected in the short term. Because other industries such as the chloride process titanium dioxide plant can choose the raw materials of high-titanium slag, artificial rutile, and natural rutile, while the welding material industry relies heavily on natural rutile and is more difficult to replace with other products.","link":"/2021/06/11/International-rutile-prices-rose-in-the-third-quarter/"},{"title":"K-2019,Düsseldorf,Germany","text":"LOCATIONDÜSSELDORF, FAIR GROUND PERIOD16 OCTOBER 2019 - 23 OCTOBER 2019 DESCRIPTIONVisionary developments and groundbreaking innovations will again lead the industry into new dimension at the world’s leading trade fair for the plastics and rubber industry.Innovative materials and technology have been at the heart of all presentations staged at the K fair in Düsseldorf, the international flagship fair for the plastics and rubber industry.

During both, the production process at the TiO2 producer and the manufacturing process of paints, coatings and composite materials, avoiding the coagulation and agglomeration of the TiO2 dispersion is important. Surface chemistry of the TiO2 dispersion can be controlled during the measurement of Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude (ESA) by regulating the pH value e.g. for avoiding flocculation of dispersion. This means: the zeta potential of the dispersion should not be or close to zero. Zeta potential is a dimension of the effective surface charge of particles and the interaction between the particles with ions in solution and particles among each other. Characterising the absolute surface charge (in an aqueous dispersion) of the TiO2pigment, negative or positive in the unit [mV], gives a decisive parameter for an ultimate application of the product. The zeta potential depends on the kind of solvent, the nature and amount of the ions in solution (specific conductivity), and the pH value. It is also the main factor determining the stability of the whole dispersion. Materials, measurement technique and devicesThe applied materials and measurement techniques are listed as follows. The measurement of the TiO2 dispersion was carried out at TINOX CHEMIE GMBH Düsseldorf. Five TiO2-pigments grades with different post-treatments in aqueous dispersion were tested. Materials:Aqueous TiO2 dispersion 10% wt, 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH (p. A.) TechniqueESA measuring system with programmable titrator. Hyper sensitive probe with 500kHz measuring frequencyESA measuring cell, pH sensor, conductivity and temperature sensor, adjustable stirrer to prevent precipitation during measurement Results and discussionMeasuring the Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude ESA delivers a clear distinction of the electrostatic properties of various grades of TiO2 in aqueous dispersions. The measurement results in figure above shows that different TiO2 grades differ in isoelectric point IEP and with regard to their zeta potential significantly from each other. Handling TiO2 dispersions in a range beyond the IEP avoids any kind of flocculation. Choosing pH values in an extreme area could be a disadvantage regarding both, the electrostatic property of the pigment surface and the ionic charge in the dispersion. With increasing ratio of Al2O3/SiO2 posttreatment of TiO2 base material the isoelectric point IEP shifts to alkaline pH. With increasing SiO2 posttreatment the positive surface charge decrease. Experienced users and specialists know well that, for example, Al2O3 and SiO2 compounds have been used for decades in TiO2 posttreatment processes. However, improvements have been made repeatedly in the type of post-treatment. E.g. in the targeted control of shell texture (dense, continuous), structure (heterogeneous, homogeneous), layer thickness, et cetera. The added value of current study lies in the method. TINOX Technical-Service uses measurement systems for highly concentrated technical formulations. During technical process dispersions are often found to be highly concentrated, muddy, colored, tempered, or electrostatically affected by additive formulations. Sedimentation is often inhibited by powerful agitators in large scale treatment containers. All these process conditions have been reported in the stability analysis showed in this article. Surface chemistry of TiO2 dispersion can be controlled during the measurement in a simultaneously and recording manner by regulating the pH value, adding additives and stirring conditions like in process. Therefore ESA-technique is a valuable tool for TINOX TiO2 product intensivication. ConclusionElectrokinetic Sonic Amplitude (ESA) measurements of highly concentrated dispersions are special measurement methods. The ESA technique has been developed for a whole range of different applications. During the technical process dispersions are often found to be highly concentrated, muddy, coloured, tempered, or electrostatically affected by additive formulations. Sedimentation is often inhibited by powerful agitators in the large scale treatment containers. All these process conditions mentioned before can be involved in the stability analysis via ESA. The results of the analysed highly concentrated samples correlate directly with the electro kinetic properties of the dispersed particle in both, the raw material and the final product. Info ESA measurement procedure The ESA method is an electro acoustic measuring technique for characterising the charge stability of particles in dispersion. An oscillating voltage, generated by an AC source, is applied to a suspension, dispersion, or emulsion. Charged particles in dispersion vibrate with the frequency of an applied electric field. One or more frequencies can be applied. Sound waves are generated by the particle oscillation at these frequencies. The amplitude of these sound waves gives the Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude (ESA). The ESA signal is proportional to the dynamic mobility of the particle which in turn is proportional to the zeta potential of the particles in dispersion. For the use of this effect a certain density difference between the dispersion medium and the particle is required. For evaluable signals the density difference has to be at least 0.2 g/cm3. The measurements can be carried out with dispersions in aqueous- and alcoholic solutions and paste-like formulations.

Suspended. This event will directly affect the global titanium raw material market, especially the future trend of the high slag raw material market of chlorinated titanium dioxide. At the same time, the production of titanium slag by the Norwegian titanium slag production plant is not very smooth, so the future titanium slag market is very severe and tight. The price of raw materials for chlorinated titanium dioxide will remain high in the future, and the production cost of chlorinated titanium dioxide will continue to increase. After China’s titanium dioxide market entered the traditional off-season, two divergences occurred. Some manufacturers carried out price increases due to the cost of raw materials, while other manufacturers threw out goods in order to clean up some inventory. However, under the pressure of high-priced raw materials, most of China’s titanium dioxide manufacturers are not willing to conduct price reductions but instead enter the state of parking and maintenance. At the same time, most titanium dioxide manufacturers’ products are relatively tight, and titanium dioxide products are out of stock in the market. The situation is still very grim, so in the traditional off-season, some manufacturers announced price increases, of which two chlorinated titanium dioxide manufacturers announced a price increase of 80-100usd, and another sulfated titanium dioxide manufacturer announced a price increase of 50usd. Future market judgment:Due to the suspension of the operation of Richards Bay Mining Company of South Africa, and according to Kenmare, the supply of high-grade titanium ore in 2020 will be very tight, and there will be no excess supply to high-slag producers and the chlorination method. Titanium dioxide factory, it is expected that the future price of chlorinated titanium dioxide market will mainly increase prices to offset the pressure brought by the cost of raw materials. It is expected that the chlorinated method will increase by about 80-120 US dollars in the near future. The future trend of high-grade titanium ore resources and high-titanium slag will continue to be tight, and it will continue to bring continuous raw material cost pressures to producers of chlorinated titanium dioxide.

And you can see that the volume in this period was not jumped down heavily. But when it came to the April and May, with the spreading of COVID-19 globally, the major economy had shut down, and volume was just less than half of its in March and hit the historically low point.“Now with the reopening of the economy in major economy, we have very good reason to believe that the needs will gradually back to normal.”, as to the expert estimated.With the historically shrinking of needs in tio2 industry, the price hit a new low in the early of June 2020, and then kept stable for a month.

Supply of titanium is expected to remain tight for the next two yearsHigh concentration of titanium raw material manufacturersGlobal ilmenite resources are concentrated in Australia, China, India, South Africa and Kenya, These five countries account for 77.50% of the global reserves, China’s titanium reserves account for 26.14% of the global reserves. South Africa, Australia, China, Mozambique and Canada as major suppliers of titanium raw material products worldwide, The total production of titanium raw materials accounts for about 70% of the total global production, China’s production of titanium raw materials (mainly titanium concentrate) accounts for 31% of the world’s total output.In terms of share, At home and abroad, High concentration, The domestic CR4( Pangang, Dragon python, Anning, Taihe) and overseas CR4(Rio Tinto, Iluka、Tronox、Kenmare) are about 60 percent. Among them high-end titanium raw materials are mainly controlled overseas, Global rutile resources are mainly distributed in Australia, Kenya, South Africa, India, The rutile reserves of the above four countries account for 93.06% of the global reserves. The resources of titanium in China are mainly in the form of ilmenite, In addition, a small amount of titanium resources exist in the form of rutile. According to the National Bureau of Statistics’2017 Statistical Yearbook of China, China’s titanium resources are mainly concentrated in Sichuan, A small amount distributed in Hubei, Shandong and other places, The reserves of titanium resources in Sichuan Province account for 90.40% of the total reserves in China. Titanium raw material resources are exhausted, grades are declining, capital expenditures are lacking, and supply will enter a downward turning point in 2020The production and demand of titanium ore will be basically balanced in 2019, and the supply and demand gap will appear from 2020. In the future, the existing mine production will decrease with the decline in reserves and grades. According to Iluka and TZMI, the waste composition of mineral sand resources under exploration continues to increase, while the accumulation of rutile/zircon continues to decline. In terms of production capacity, the supply of titanium ore will shrink in the future, and the unit cost will increase accordingly. Iluka’s unit titanium raw material cost has risen for two consecutive years, and Kenmare also expects the unit cost of titanium raw material to increase from 2019. Rio Tinto also expects the overall supply and demand balance of titanium ore in 2019.Since then, the overall supply of titanium ore (high-grade + low-grade) has shown a downward trend. The overall demand growth rate for titanium raw materials is expected to be 2.3%. The above analysis shows that Rio Tinto’s judgment on the 2.3% demand growth rate for titanium raw materials is not optimistic.Iluka expect 2019 to be the critical point of supply and demand for high-grade titanium ores. Based on the expansion advantage of future chlorination method over sulfuric acid method, the annual demand growth rate of high-grade titanium ores in the next five years is about 5%. The production of high-grade chloride raw materials will decrease from 2019, assuming that the capacity utilization ratio of idle titanium slag reaches 75%, and the annual output growth rate of high-grade chloride raw materials in the next five years is only about 1%, which is difficult to meet the demand. Note: according to the TZMI forecast, the demand for high grade chloride raw materials will increase by about 5% per year in the next five years; figures 11 and 12 do not include Iluka high grade raw materials items. Judging from the capital expenditure of the global titanite leader: Since the upward stage H1 titanium dioxide cycle in 2016 H2 2018, the price increase of titanium raw materials is limited, and neither the price nor the profits of related companies have been repaired to the peak level of 2010 2011 cycle, so the capital expenditure of some titanium mining companies has increased at the beginning of 2018, but the overall range is not large; Among them, Rio Tinto, Iluka and Kenmare have had more significant capital expenditures since 2018, Others, such as Tino, have little additional capital spending on titanium, The main focus of the company and the integration of the original assets of Koster (the original Terno and Koster each have titanium matching, There is room for optimization from the supply chain (s); And since 2020, Except for Kenmare, the capital expenditure of other companies has fallen sharply, Company conditions vary, Such as Rio Tinto’s previous work due to local violence and the suspension of the epidemic, Iluka large capital expenditure has been cashed in (Cataby production cashed in, Sierra less than expected, completed impairment), Base resources pre-work due to the stagnation of the epidemic (the final investment has not yet been decided); Referring to the historical capital expenditure and output relationship of several leading firms, Can be seen that the high output is basically lagging behind the high capital expenditure of 3~6 years or so, Basically corresponding to the mining investment-mining cycle time, Iluka Cataby projects and Sierra projects that started production in 2019, for example, started pre-project work by 2016 and Moma expansion by 2017; Combined with the foregoing analysis, As capital expenditures of several leading companies have been cashed in since 2019(Iluka、Image) or halted for various reasons, including the outbreak, (b) We judge that there is no significant supply increment except Kenmare in the next three years or so; For the next two years, the production increase of 300 thousand tons of titanium high slag, which is basically only Kenmare overseas is determinedSpecific follow-up analysis of the recent output and capital expenditure of overseas titanium companies shows that: Rio Tinto’s Rio Tinto：Zulti North is declining, with the South Mine only spending on maintenance / alternative capital to compensate for the decline in grade and production in the North Mine, and the company is reassessing its investment of A $463 million due to the impact of the violence from the end of 2019 to the present. Iluka：Cataby project is positioned to compensate for the volume reduction caused by the Tutunup closure, which closed in February 2018; The project plans to produce a total of 440000 tons of ilmenite, Of these ,370,000 tons were used for 200,000 tons of synthetic rutile, So the sale of ilmenite is planned for 70,000 tons, Another 30,000 tons of natural rutile, The production of synthetic rutile increased by 111600 tons in the first half of 2020, Basically achieve the project planning objectives; Sierra project investment was unsuccessful, Production was lower than expected, The company made a large amount of impairment in 2019, In terms of corporate guidance, The future will be used only as maintenance capital expenditure; The company’s overall capital expenditure in the first half of 2020 is $50 million, Mainly for Eneabba monazite project, Sembehun(20 to 30 km northwest of the existing Sierra rutile mine operation area), pre-project work (research), Balranald and Nepean project potential assessment, pre-project evaluation (zircon and rare earth), As a result Iluka no significant increase in titanium production is expected in the next three years. Note: SR1 project is only 110000 tons of synthetic rutile production, not involving new mining of titanium ilmenite. BASE RESOURCES: The feasibility study of the Toliara project was completed at the end of 2019 and is still in the early stage. The final investment decision time was postponed to the second half of 2020. Kwale Phase 1 mining area production reduction, the company mining from the central sand dunes to the south, to make up for the central mining area depletion. Kenmare: The company’s capital expenditure in the past two years is mainly Moma projects, gradually put into production ,2019 output of 893000 tons ,2022 target of 1.2 million tons, the next two years year climbing ,12~150000 tons per year. Shefield: Thunderbird Thunderbird project, The company announced on June 11,2019, Will delay the construction of the TiFe roasting facility at Thunderbird in western Australia, To give priority to zircon, (a) The announcement in April 2020 that the maintenance and maintenance of the Thunderbird project was formally suspended; Yan Gang announced in August 2020 that it would invest A $130.1 billion to acquire a 50 per cent stake in the project, The funds will be used for the first phase of the Thunderbird project, At the same time, the project export ilmenite ownership, We expect the project to start production in 2023 and beyond. Image Resources: Boonanarring project has been put into operation, HMC,240,000 tons planned To 30~330,000 tons HMC, projected The corresponding sub-product upgrade is similar, From December 2019, Mine life is estimated at 6 years; Atlas project is expected to be no less than Boonanarring mining area, Atlas main role, Continue mining after the end of the Boonanarring. Tronox: Tronox announced a complete cessation of external sales of rutile at the end of 2018; the mine in former Koster stopped production in October 2018 and resumed in August 2019, but is expected to decline. Sibelco: The production of rutile by major producers, such as Sibelco,Iluka, declined after the depletion of resources in the Murray Basin in southeastern Australia; Sibelco mines in Stradbroke Island, Australia, are scheduled to close by 2020 for environmental reasons. Overall :2019 to date, Although all Ikula、Image、Kenmare have titanium, Iluka two new and Image projects, however, have already had an impact on the market supply, If we look H2-2022 2020, Sheffield、Base titanium projects are expected to release as soon as 2023 due to the impact of the epidemic, The Rio Tinto South Mine, which was expected to start production by the end of 2021, is still suspended in the early stages of local violence and the pandemic, and is mainly used as an alternative capital expenditure for the North Mine, The Australian East Zirconia Atlas program is only an alternative capacity for Boonanarring projects, and Boonanarring still has more than five years of service, Therefore, during 2020 H2-2022 only Kenmare 300000 tons of titanium concentrate production is relatively certain. Therefore, Less than 150000 tons of titanium concentrate per year can only meet the demand of about 60,000 tons of titanium dioxide, Far from 200,000 tons of titanium dioxide a year, And during 2021 2022 due to the existence of replenishment stocks, The apparent demand is expected to be greater than the real demand.","link":"/2020/11/27/Supply-of-titanium-is-expected-to-remain-tight-for-the-next-two-years/"},{"title":"TRONOX received a $4.3 billion offer for a exclusive buyout from APOLLO.","text":"As to reuters.com, Greg Roumeliotis, the Private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) has approached Tronox Holdings Plc (TROX.N), one of the world’s largest pigment manufacturers, with a $4.3 billion all-cash offer, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.EXCLUSIVE Buyout firm Apollo makes $4.3 billion offer to buy Tronox -sources.","link":"/2021/09/14/TRONOX-received-a-4-3-billion-offer-for-a-exclusive-buyout-from-APOLLO/"},{"title":"The fifth round of price increases during the year landed, titanium dioxide price rose for 11 consecutive months","text":"stcn.com, Zhaoliyun Original content 年内第五轮涨价落地 钛白粉连涨11个月 As a product whose price fluctuations have attracted much attention from the market before, the announcement of titanium dioxide’s recent rise has been submerged in the “rising sound” of various commodities one after another. Inadvertently, titanium dioxide has been rising for 11 consecutive months, and the fifth round of price increases this year has also landed one after another, and the record for the longest product price increase is about to be broken. The price hike lasted for nearly a yearOn May 10, the leader of the titanium dioxide industry, Lomon Baili(Known as LomonBillions), issued an announcement stating that, according to the current domestic and international titanium dioxide market conditions, the company will start from now on all types of titanium dioxide (including sulfuric acid titanium dioxide, chloride titanium dioxide) On the basis of the original price, the sales price will be raised by RMB 1,000/ton for various domestic customers and USD 150/ton for international customers. Prior to this, another leading company in the industry, CNNC HUA YUAN Titanium Dioxide Co., Ltd(Known as CHTI), also issued a price adjustment announcement, stating that the overall increase in the sales price of the company’s main products will help further enhance the company’s continued profitability and improve the company’s market position and influence. It is expected to have an impact on the company’s operations. The results will have a positive impact. The price adjustments of Lomon Baili and CNNC HUA YUAN Titanium Dioxide Co., Ltd are not alone. After the May 1st holiday, the titanium dioxide price market has remained strong and stable. “At present, more than ten manufacturers including Anada, Hengtong Titanium, Longteng Titanium, Jiangsu Zhentai, Shandong Dongjia, Jinpu Titanium, Shandong Dawn, etc. have sent letters announcing an increase of 1,000 yuan/ton, in addition to Southwest etc. Several producers in the region went straight up by 800-1000 yuan/ton without letter, continuing the bullish market sentiment. The price market is already the fifth round of price increases this year.” Yan Ti analyst Yang Xun said. Yang Xun introduced that the mainstream prices of most domestic sulfuric acid rutile and anatase titanium dioxides currently range from 19,800 to 21,000 yuan/ton and 18,300 to 19,000 yuan/ton. Domestic and imported chlorinated rutile titanium dioxides differentiate the mainstream prices by use At 21500-23500 yuan / ton and 27000-28500 yuan / ton (the above are all tax-included cash outbound prices). Since July 2020, the titanium dioxide market has been rising for 11 consecutive months, almost equal to the longest continuous rise record of titanium dioxide in 2016. The price market continues to be strong, and the price of holders is relatively hard. For low-price inquiries More resistant, more inclined to cash orders. Zhuochuang analyst Tian Xiaoyu also said that the current domestic titanium dioxide market has been rising for 11 months, and the market price will also break through the historical high since 2012. During the period, as the most upstream of the titanium dioxide industry chain, titanium concentrate performed more prominently. In the second half of 2020 alone, the growth rate exceeded 65%, and in some stages it provided strong cost support for the price of titanium dioxide. Cost support high price continuationWhat are the factors supporting the continued increase in the price of titanium dioxide? Is the price increase sustainable? Yang Xun said that the current trading market is still very confrontational, and the price market is in a state of gaming. In terms of demand, industries such as plastic color masterbatches have entered the off-season, and overall demand has declined. At the same time, the downward transmission of costs is difficult, and it is more resistant to high-priced titanium dioxide, and production is simply stopped. In addition, high-priced titanium dioxide forces end customers to try alternatives. However, on the supply side, titanium concentrates are always tight and expensive, and the raw material cost of titanium dioxide remains high. At present, the market has a large number of foreign trade orders, and the main manufacturers have received orders until June. The vast majority of manufacturers and distributors are tight in stock, especially some of the main brand products. What needs attention is that environmental inspections and emergencies have also caused some regional producers to suspend production, causing production capacity to shrink. Cost support is indeed one of the main reasons why the price of titanium dioxide continues to rise.“Titanium concentrate is the main and important raw material in the production of titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide accounts for nearly 96% of the downstream consumption of titanium concentrate. Others are mostly used in the manufacture of sponge titanium. Since the bottom of the price in 2020, the price of titanium concentrate has doubled. The current national market average price is 2450 yuan/ton. At the end of April, major Panxi major manufacturers raised their sales guidance prices for May by 80-100 yuan/ton. Supported by the price of titanium concentrates on the main cost surface, the domestic titanium dioxide market after Labor Day A new round of growth has begun.” Tian Xiaoyu said. Regarding the market outlook, Yang Xun believes that in the short term, the game between supply and demand is obvious, demand enters the off-season, and the terminal is more resistant to high-level titanium dioxide; supply-side manufacturers have high costs, smooth exports, tight spot prices, and low start-ups. Without the support of demand, the mid- to long-term market trend is still unclear, but the profit in May is as expected, and the current real order price is strong and firm.","link":"/2021/05/14/The-fifth-round-of-price-increases-during-the-year-landed-titanium-dioxide-price-rose-for-11-consecutive-months/"},{"title":"The forecasted wave of price increases of TiO2 is coming in China","text":"The influence of RBM’s Halt production is now able to see.

Since March, the price of 90 titanium slag has risen at a relatively large pace, mostly around 400 yuan/ton. The slowdown in the price increase this time indicates that the high-titanium slag market will enter a period of relatively stable prices in the future. The reason why the price of high-titanium slag rose sharply in March and April was mainly due to the rapid increase in the price of ilmenite leading to rising costs. Recently, the northern high-titanium slag enterprises have gradually completed the establishment of ilmenite inventory, and the average ilmenite inventory is about 2-3 months. Therefore, the production cost of high-titanium slag in the north will be relatively stable in the future, and a single increase of 400 yuan/ton will temporarily bid farewell to the market. From a long-term trend, with the gradual resumption of production of western titanium dioxide companies, the demand for ilmenite in the West will also gradually increase, and the corresponding supply to the Chinese market will decrease. The recent discovery of a mutated new coronavirus in Vietnam has brought certain uncertainty to the future market trend. The Vietnamese market is my country’s main source of titanium slag raw materials. Although the supply has declined in recent years, it has maintained a relatively stable supply. In contrast, although ilmenite from Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Falkland Islands, and Norway appeared on the market some time ago, they cannot become a stable source. If the spread of the new coronavirus in Vietnam affects its export of ilmenite to my country, it may push up the price of domestic titanium chloride ore in the future. After the current inventory of ilmenite in the titanium slag plant is exhausted, the price of titanium slag may change again due to the cost of ilmenite.","link":"/2021/06/09/The-high-titanium-slag-market-enters-a-short-period-of-stability/"},{"title":"The global supply of tio2 is getting worse.","text":"After the force majeure announcement of RBM, the market of CP grades TiO2 was expected to raise in 3rd and 4th quarter.

Rio Tinto declares force majeure at Richards Bay Minerals. Why RBM is so important to TiO2 industry?Located on the eastern shores of South Africa, 180 km north of Durban, Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) produces approximately 2.0 million metric tonnes of product annually making RBM a leading producer of titania slag, high purity pig iron, rutile and zircon.Heavy minerals are extracted from the nearby dunes by dredging and concentration on a floating gravity separation plant, followed by separation of the ilmenite, rutile and zircon at the mineral separation plant located at the smelter site. The ilmenite is processed through an oxidizing roast followed by magnetic separation and is then partially reduced to an 85 per cent TiO2 slag in one of four six-in-line a.c. electric arc furnaces. The slag is milled and then classified into twoproduct sizes suitable as a raw material for both the sulphate and chloride pigment processes. The high quality iron produced during the reduction process is further processed to produce various grades of low-manganese iron.Around 95 per cent of the products are exported, yielding a world market share of about 25 per cent of titania slag, rutile, high quality pig iron, and zircon.See more details at Heavy Mineral Processing at Richards Bay Minerals. The price of tio2 will surge again?Even now, the RBM throwed a huge stone into the calm lake. But still we are conservative to the price trend. Firstly, the market continues to wait and see.Now, the price is at a historial high level. After the stock cleaning, the distributors are not yet planing to make new stocks. And to the tio2 manufactures, after the fulfilling of first half orders, now only few obtained orders at hand. Some tio2 manufactures even got into panic and start to lower the price for orders. But their cost is not low, so they choose to make special offers to certain buyers. Some analysists refers that it is a centralized-cleaning of inferior products produced in the previous production. Secondly, RBM’s issue needs time to pass the wave.Most of RBM raw is in high grade supplied to chloride production. And firstly, the impact will on the international CP grade producers. According to reliable source, the Kronos’ long term supply contract is one of the first contracts to be suspended. Last by not least, the trend may shows two-level differentiation in shorterm.To the SP suppliers from China, the shortage of oredrs is still the fact to small and medium tio2 manufacturers. Those who can not take the pressure may turned to adjust their price strategy.But under the impact of RBM, the CP grade tio2 manufactures has no doubt will increase their price to cease the impacts in fourth quarter. And gradually, this impact will be passed to SP tio2 manufactures also. Any forecasts or suggests?To our estimation, the general price of SP grades may slightly drop in shorterm, but not much, and the second half of 2021, it is still on a solid strong ground.To CP grades, the big players may announce a new round of price increase in the middle of August 2021.Suggestion?

It was identified as a weak titanium dioxide market after the Shanghai Coatings Exhibition. The end market has severely reduced prices, and the price market has become increasingly clear. Some manufacturers have adjusted their prices after the meeting. Panzhihua Haifengxin Chemical announced a rise of 200 yuan / ton against the trend, which aroused the attention of many people. The main reason for the increase is the high cost of raw materials and the shortage of spot supply in the market. The force is not strong, and the initial intention is obvious. At present, the spot prices of manufacturers in Shandong, Anhui, Panzhihua and other regions continue to be tight. These manufacturers have maintained stable prices since the first drop in early November. In fact, the price adjustment is also very reluctant. On the one hand, they must adapt to market trends and maintain reasonable prices for first-tier brands. On the other hand, spot supply is tight due to low operating rates and other reasons. In long and short situations, the big picture can be the focus. Foreign trade, terminals and channels have different supply priorities. The price market is gradually rationalizing, and the obvious performance is that the market price gradient is obvious. The price difference of similar products is about 1,500 yuan / ton, and the price span has gradually narrowed. The market price positioning of products is mainly determined by value, supply and demand relationship, and value is determined by quality, brand, psychological expectations and many other factors. Matching titanium dioxide at any price. The focus is on quality. The psychological expectation is that big brands are high-quality and expensive. [The export volume of titanium dioxide in October 2019 decreased by 5.26% month-on-month] According to the statistics provided by the General Administration of Customs, China’s imports of titanium dioxide in October 2019 were 18,240.04 tons, a 63% increase from the previous month and a 10.77% increase from the same period last year. The average import price for the month was USD2902.04/ton. From January to October 2019, the cumulative import volume of titanium dioxide was 130508.04 tons, and the cumulative average import price was 3011.27 USD/ton, a YoY decrease of 18.86%. In October 2019, China’s titanium dioxide export volume was 7,9400.99 tons, a MoM decrease of 5.26% and YoY increase of 26.08%. The average export price for the month was USD2,117.06/ton. From January to October 2019, the cumulative export volume of titanium dioxide was 820,784.14 tons, and the cumulative average export price was USD2,222.35/ton, a YoY increase of 5.82%. [Lonmonbillions: Xinli Titanium Industry will resume design capacity as soon as possible] On November 22, Lonmonbillions (002601) answered investors’ questions on the interactive platform and stated that Yunnan Metallurgical Xinli Titanium Industry Co., Ltd. has an annual output of 60,000 tons of titanium dioxide, 10,000 tons of titanium sponge per year and 80,000 Ton. With three production lines per ton / year of high titanium slag, the company will resume the design capacity as soon as possible. Currently, most China domestic rutile sulfates and anatase titanium dioxides are priced at RMB 13,500-15500 / t and RMB 11,500-12500 / t. The China domestic and imported rutile titanium dioxide is 17500-20000 according to the application amount. RMB / ton and RMB 25,000-27,000 / ton (the above are all spot prices without tax). According to foreign media reports, on the afternoon of November 27, Beijing time, a chemical plant in PortNeches, Texas, exploded, and nearby residents were evacuated. No casualties were reported, but an explosion was reported in the Huntsman chemical plant, which damaged nearby buildings. According to TPC’s website, there are more than 200 people working here. The plant produces butadiene (combustible gas used to produce synthetic rubber (12640, 70.00, 0.56%)) and other petrochemical products, such as butane. Yan Titanium industry analysts believe that the explosion has no impact on the titanium dioxide market. Huntsman did explode, but it was not a titanium dioxide factory. More precisely, Huntsman has no titanium dioxide business. In 1998, the United States Huntsman Corporation (HUNTSMAN) acquired a 70% stake in Tioxide Group PLG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Empire Chemical Industry Corporation (ICI), and TIOXIDE titanium dioxide has since belonged to HUNTSMAN. On July 24, 2017, Venator was born out of Huntsman in the United States and independently operated Huntsman’s titanium dioxide and high-performance additive business. Second, market outlookThis week, the China domestic titanium dioxide price market is weak. Yan Xun, an analyst with Yan Titanium and Titanium, believes that November has closed, and the price market in the post-coating exhibition era is gradually clear. A few personalized operations are expected to have little impact on the price market. The price market at the beginning of December is more critical and directly affects the foundation of the multi-year market. Most manufacturers and distributors mainly collect payments. Most of the orders with small profits but quick turnover and fast-in and fast-out may be born in December. Some holders are The sales volume and receipts of the business may be increased, or unconventional prices may appear, but most terminals are more rational. In the short term, the price market at the beginning of December was mainly stalemate and stabilized. Individual orders were negotiated with the amount of use and the form of payment. When the buyer and the seller meet their needs, all prices are reasonable.","link":"/2019/12/02/TiO2-market-analysis-20191131/"},{"title":"TiO2 market analysis weekly updates, 1st week of June, 2021","text":"Keyword: FlatStill the market is quiet this week, nobody is making noise at this point of time.

Meanwhile, in Guangxi and Guangdong province, the power is limited supply, and meets only half the needs of normal. Surprisingly, the Anatase supply is getting more tight than expected. As we all know, in the past, more and more users are shitfing to the Rutile grades due to its outstanding performance comparing with Anatase. But now, we found that, many users are shifting back to Anatase due the crazy price increase of Rutile, to whom a little compromise in quality is not a serious issue. But more importantly, most of the producers of Anatase already shift their production line to Rutile and not willing to shit it back yet.

In fact, entering May, listed companies such as Jinpu Titanium (000545.SZ) and Anada (002136.SZ) have also begun to raise the sales price of titanium dioxide, and the price increase in this round remains the same. Recently, the share prices of listed titanium dioxide companies have shown an upward trend. Benefiting from the continued rise in the price of titanium dioxide, the first quarter performance of the leading listed companies in the industry hit a new high during the same period. An executive of Lomon Baili said in an interview with a reporter from “China Business News” that generally price increases are determined by cost and demand. This year’s consecutive price increases are mainly due to rising raw material costs and strong market demand; especially foreign market demand Further strengthening has made the first quarter performance of domestic titanium dioxide listed companies soar. Start a new wave of price increases? In the midday of May 6, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. issued an announcement stating that the company’s price committee decided that from now on, on the basis of the current sales price of titanium dioxide, the company’s sales prices for various types of titanium dioxide will be raised. Among them, the sales price for domestic customers is raised by RMB 1,000/ton, and the export price for international customers is raised by USD150/ton. The reporter noticed that since the beginning of this year, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. has issued monthly announcements on raising the sales price of titanium dioxide. Looking at the leopard, as the industry’s leading company, the continuous price increase of CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. also represents the titanium dioxide industry. In fact, in addition to CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd., the two listed companies of Jinpu Titanium Industry and Anada also raised the sales price of titanium dioxide, and the price increase of the three companies remained the same, which also indicates that titanium dioxide is expected to start a new round of price increases. tide. Regarding the reasons for the price increase, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. said that it decided to increase the price “according to the recent market conditions of titanium dioxide and the increase in raw material prices.” Ananda also stated that the company decided to increase prices based on recent domestic and international market demand for titanium dioxide and rising prices of raw materials. Earlier, Fu Yijiang, deputy secretary-general of the Titanium Dioxide Branch of the China Coatings Industry Association, said in an interview that after the global new crown pneumonia epidemic, the market is optimistic and demand is the main reason for the strong titanium dioxide market. The coatings, automotive paint and other markets have improved recently. Driven the increase in market demand for titanium dioxide, exports will continue to increase. According to Fu Yijiang’s analysis, the upstream raw material of titanium dioxide is titanium concentrate, and its downstream applications are extensive, including coatings, automotive paint, medicine, food and other industries. The price of upstream titanium concentrate rose by 53% from June 2020 to February 2021. Downstream coatings, automotive paints and other fields are the application areas of titanium dioxide. In 2020, the national commercial housing sales area was 1.761 billion square meters, an increase of 2.6% year-on-year; the recent price increase in the coating industry has been soaring, and the price of titanium concentrate has continued to rise. According to statistics from Zhuo Chuang Information, as of the end of April, the price of 46% titanium concentrate has been raised by RMB 150/ton from the previous month, with an average price of RMB 2,450/ton; on April 29, Panxi’s mainstream mining companies will guide their new orders for titanium concentrate prices in May. Raise 80 yuan/ton; as of the end of April, the market price of sulfuric acid in Shandong increased by 140 yuan/ton to 570 yuan/ton, and the price in the East China market rose by 60 yuan/ton to 565 yuan/ton. At the beginning of last July, the titanium concentrate was only 1175 yuan per ton. The price of ilmenite concentrate has risen, and the price of sulfuric acid in the upstream is superimposed. These two major cost pressures have brought greater impetus to the price of the upstream market of titanium dioxide. The Titanium Concentrate Analyst of Business Club believes that the actual price of titanium concentrate in Panxi is relatively strong, and the spot of titanium concentrate continues to be tight, and some miners are reluctant to sell it. The new price of titanium concentrate may rise steadily, and it is actually single. Discussion. According to data from Baichuan, on April 23, the mainstream price of sulfuric acid rutile titanium dioxide market was 20000 to 21000 yuan/ton, the mainstream price of anatase titanium dioxide market was 17300~18000 yuan/ton, and the mainstream price of chloride titanium dioxide market was It is 22000 to 24000 yuan/ton. Fu Yijiang told reporters that with the gradual improvement of the global epidemic, the climax of global resumption of production and work, coupled with the implementation of a new round of stimulus of 1.9 trillion USD by the Biden administration, has hindered the US industrial chain caused by the epidemic. In the context of a rapid rebound in U.S. demand driven by scale stimulus, U.S. imports from China have surged. From January to February this year, Chinese exports soared by 60.6% in U.S. dollars, of which exports to the United States increased by 87.3%. In December 2020, the United States passed a 900 billion USD stimulus package to promote a 10.8% year-on-year growth in US retail sales in January 2021, the highest increase in history since March 1994. It is expected that the 1.9 trillion USD stimulus will further drive the high increase in US imports from China, especially the demand for consumer goods and real estate-related commodities. At the same time, he said that the U.S., Europe and the “Belt and Road” markets are gradually recovering, and the domestic and international dual cycles are oriented towards mutual promotion, which has become the new strategic direction of the Chinese economy after the epidemic. The demand for domestic and foreign consumer goods and real estate-related commodities will greatly stimulate China’s production output is increasing, and titanium dioxide is a rigid demand product in many fields. From the current global market, titanium dioxide will still be in a situation of “supply exceeds demand” in the short term. According to the analysis of Zhuo Chuang Information, after the holiday, as expected, the logic of the market price increase in May will be clearer, including direct support from the cost-side raw material price increase and continued tight spot supply support. At present, downstream users on the demand side have also begun. In the face of continuous consumption of inventory, regular purchase plans need to be put on the agenda at the same time. Under high prices, the market outlook may show rigidity, so that in the process of price increases, the game advantages of buyers and sellers will still be biased towards the sellers, and ultimately promote the upward market price. . CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. also stated that the company will closely follow the price trend of titanium dioxide and changes in supply and demand, and do a good job in adjusting the price of titanium dioxide products in a timely manner. The overall increase in the sales price of the company’s main products will help further enhance the company’s continued profitability, and will help improve the company’s market position and influence. It is expected to have a positive impact on the company’s operating results. Corporate performance rises Benefiting from the improvement of the industry’s prosperity, leading titanium dioxide companies performed well in the first quarter. The reporter sorted out the financial report and noticed that recently, the first quarter of 2021 financial reports released by leading companies such as Jinpu Titanium Industry, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd., Anada, Lubei Chemical and other listed companies in the titanium dioxide industry showed that their performance has achieved substantial growth. The financial report shows that on May 6, Jinpu Titanium released its first quarter report of 2021. During the reporting period, the company achieved operating income of 574 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.98%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 35 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1308.05 %. On April 30, Lubei Chemical (600727.SH) released the report for the first quarter of 2021. The company achieved total operating income of 928 million yuan, an increase of 38.73% year-on-year; net profit attributable to the parent company was 107 million yuan, an increase of 136.8% year-on-year. In addition, on April 26, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. released its report for the first quarter of 2021. The company’s revenue was 1.236 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 49.53%; net profit was about 287 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 77.29%. Huiyun Titanium Industry (300891.SZ) released its first quarterly report for 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, the company achieved operating income of 319 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 51.99%. The net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 45 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 81.25%. . On April 24, Anadar issued a report for the first quarter of 2021. During the reporting period, the company achieved operating income of 406 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 58.50%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 31 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 28.54%. Regarding the substantial increase in performance, Jinpu Titanium Industry stated that during the reporting period, the increase in operating income and profit was mainly due to the increase in sales volume, sales price and increase in the sales price of titanium dioxide, the main product during the reporting period, and the increase in gross profit. Economist Song Qinghui analyzed to reporters that the sharp rise in profits of listed companies is also a manifestation of the industry’s further elimination of backward production capacity in the market in recent years, the continuous increase of industry concentration, and the manifestation of intensive benefits. It can be seen that in recent years, leading titanium dioxide companies have expanded their layout and occupied market share. At the end of February 2020, China Nuclear Power Titanium Dioxide released a 1.6 billion yuan fixed increase plan, and plans to raise funds for the 200,000 tons/year titanium dioxide post-processing project. Subsequently, on April 23, Lomon Baili issued an announcement stating that the number of non-public offerings would not exceed 368 million shares, and the total amount of raised funds would not exceed 4.387 billion yuan for use in titanium chloride slag and chlorinated titanium dioxide. Production and construction and supplementary working capital. At the same time, in 2020, after Lubei Chemical acquired Jinhai Titanium Industry and Xianghai Titanium Industry, the titanium dioxide business became the company’s largest business. Lubei Chemical currently has an annual production capacity of over 100,000 tons of sulfuric acid titanium dioxide, and is proceeding in an orderly manner with the construction of a production line of 100,000 tons of sulfuric acid titanium dioxide and a production line of 60,000 tons of chloride titanium dioxide. After the project is completed, its titanium dioxide production capacity will reach 26 Million tons. Qin Chong, a researcher at China Research and Puhua, told reporters that in 2019, the top 5 companies in the world’s titanium dioxide production capacity accounted for 90% of the industry’s production capacity, while the top ten concentration of my country’s titanium dioxide industry was about 68%, referring to the global situation It can be seen that there will still be acquisitions in the titanium dioxide industry in my country in the future to cater to the development trend of the industry. At the same time, with the help of listed companies, funding channels have been increased, and risk resistance has been increased for the development of enterprises. In addition, due to the implementation of environmental protection policies, the policy-oriented chlorination process will become the mainstream, and the new production capacity will basically be chlorination, which is also a manifestation of the company’s catering to the market.","link":"/2021/05/10/TiO2-material-shortage-has-no-sign-of-easing/"},{"title":"TiO2 pigment dispersions for dip coating applications by means of electrokinetic sonic amplitude","text":"Daniel Moog The high-quality white pigment titanium dioxide has many applications. Coagulation or agglomeration of a TiO2 dispersion must be avoided at all costs, both in the manufacturing process and in the processing, e.g. by manufacturers of paints and coatings. This applies in particular to highly filled systems, such as pigment preparations and pigment pastes, where a high degree of particle stabilization is indispensable. Purely electrostatic stabilization is not sufficient to stabilize highly concentrated pigment preparations and pigment pastes in such a way that they do not exhibit flocculation and segregation states during storage and processing. For this reason, highly filled systems are stabilized either purely sterically or in a certain ratio of electrostatic and steric stabilization. Stabilization with electrostatic and steric components is referred to as electro-steric stabilization. Illustration of the measurement setupFig.1: Illustration of the measurement setup(a) ESA probe, (b) measurement chamber,(c) mechanical stirrer, (d) pipette,(e) dispersion, (f) pH probe and(g) conductivity probe. [Source:“Electroacoustic Quantification of SurfaceBound Ligands in Functionalized Silica andIron Oxide Nanoparticles”, Whiley Publishers]By adjusting the ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization, it may be possible to adjust the viscosity properties of the products. To maintain structural viscosity properties, as is often required in the field of paints and coatings, electrostatic stabilization is often necessary. For viscosities that should be independent of the shear rate (Newtonian viscosity behavior), purely steric stabilization may be useful. The electroacoustic ESA measuring technique used is used to record the stabilization process during the addition of additives to an aqueous TiO2 pigment preparation (Figure 1). The measured data show the level and type of stabilization as a function of the added additive concentration. By using the ESA method, additive concentrations can be determined which lead to defined electro-steric or steric stabilization ratios. These dispersion states, which are now known, can then be transferred to the formulation development or formulation optimization of a pigment preparation. In summary, the following advantages result from the use of the ESA measuring technique for recording a stabilization process through the addition of additives: Assignment of quantitative stability states to the added additive quantities. Exact adjustment of electro-steric or pure steric stabilization states. Avoidance of additive excess by detection of the complete surface coverage with the surface affine additive groups. Estimation of the polymer layer thickness applied to the particles by the electrical double layer. Control of dispersion products after storage or in production. Evaluation of the ESA raw data signal enables measurement and evaluation without knowledge of the physical substance data. With knowledge of physical substance data, an exact derivation of the zeta potential from the ESA raw data signal is possible. Materials, measurement technology and devicesThe materials used for the measurements and the measuring technique are listed below. The measurements were carried out by the company Pulveranalyse Dipl.-Ing. Daniel Moog, a contract laboratory specializing in dispersion analysis. Two titanium dioxide pigment grades were tested which are to be used in highly concentrated pigment preparations as a pre- product in the sector of water-based dip coating products. Materials:Aqueous TiO2 dispersion 10 % wt solids.Solvent-free wetting and dispersing additive for waterborne coating applications, consisting of a copolymer with pigment affinity groups. TiO2-Pigment SP-Rutile for paints and coatings TINOX R-2160 TiO2-Pigment SP Rutile for paints and coatings TINOX R-2140Measurement:ESA measuring system with high sensitive probe with 500 kHz measuring frequency.50 ml Teflon measuring cell, pH sensor, conductivity and temperature sensor, adjustable stirring system to prevent sedimentation during measurement.Software for data recording.Devices:Ultraturrax T18 for dispersion with tool S18 N-19G Results and discussionBy measuring the electrokinetic sonic amplitude, the processes during the stabilization of the TiO2 grades in aqueous dispersion can be accurately recorded. The results show that the additive used in the concentration of (4-7) % recommended by the additive manufacturer leads to electro-steric mixing stabilization for both TiO2 pigments (Figure 2 and 3). The wetting and coating of the TiO2 pigment surfaces with the additive polymer leads to a decrease in the zeta potential, which is also a measure of the thickness of the applied polymer layer. The ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization can be detected and thus precisely adjusted. zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigmentFig.2: Recording of the decrease of the zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment during additive addition. The measurementwas carried out under strong stirring, which prevents sedimentation and ensures homogeneous mixing. zeta potential of TINOX R-2140 TiO2 pigmentFig.3: Recording of the decrease of the zeta potential of TINOX R-2140 TiO2 pigment during additive addition. The measurementwas carried out under strong stirring, which prevents sedimentation and ensures homogeneous mixing. In the concentrations of (4-7)% on TiO2 recommended by the additive manufacturer, electrostatic mixing stabilization occurs for both pigment grades, with higher electrostatic contents remaining for TINOX R-2140 at the same additive concentration. The results show that the recommended additive concentrations of the additive manufacturers are good guidelines, but that the surface chemistry of the titanium dioxide pigments can vary so much due to post-treatment processes and manufacturing methods that for many TiO2-pigment grades a precise adjustment of the formulation is necessary. This is especially true when highly filled systems are manufactured at the maximum possible concentration, as is the case with pigment formulations and pigment pastes.ConclusionThe ESA technique used in the present experiments has been elaborated in a particular way for different applications. In the technical production process, dispersions are usually highly concentrated, turbid, colored or tempered. They are often electrostatically influenced by added additive formulations. Often the sedimentation of the mixture in the reactor must be prevented by powerful agitators. Stability analysis by means of electrokinetic sonic amplitude includes all parameters. Thus, the data of the samples analyzed in highly concentrated form can be directly transferred to the electrokinetic properties of the dispersed particles in the raw material or in the finished product. By controlled recording of the stabilization process, it was possible to develop a stable semi-finished product with TINOX R-2140 as a pigment preparation with 78% TiO2 for aqueous dip coating applications, which showed no tendency to agglomeration even during subsequent strong dilution processes. The stabilization process could be deciphered a bit further and the dispersion states can be checked by means of ESA technology for process and quality control (see illustration Figure 4). metrological recording of stabilization prozessFig.4: Illustration of the metrological recording of the stabilization process. Information on the measurement method usedFrom a scientific point of view, the use of the ESA measurement technique is a method for direct quantification of accessible hydroxide groups on the surface of particles and a profound way for surface quantification of different ligands. While electrophoretic methods for zeta potential surface characterization for technical applications are limited by too high dilutions, sedimentation processes, irregular particle shape or inaccessible physical substance data, the ESA method is a complementary measurement technique for analysis in technical applications. The ESA method for characterizing the charge stability of particles in a dispersion is an electroacoustic measurement technique. An oscillating voltage is applied to a suspension, dispersion or emulsion, which is generated by an alternating current source. Charged particles in the dispersion oscillate at the frequency of the externally applied electric field. One or more frequencies can be applied. The oscillation of the particles at these frequencies generates sonic waves. The amplitudes of these sonic waves are measured as electrokinetic sonic amplitude (ESA). This ESA signal is proportional to the dynamic mobility of the particles and this in turn is proportional to the zeta potential of the particles present in the dispersion. A prerequisite for the use of this effect is a certain density difference between dispersion medium and particle. To generate evaluable signals, this density difference must be at least 0.2 g/cm3.","link":"/2021/09/03/TiO2-pigment-dispersions-for-dip-coating-applications-by-means-of-electrokinetic-sonic-amplitude/"},{"title":"Tio2 Market Analysis before 2021","text":"BriefFrom January to September of 2020, the comprehensive output of the whole industry reached about 2.4 million tons, and the total output for the year is expected to reach about 3.4 million tons, an increase of 4.0% year-on-yearWhile the domestic market environment is gradually improving, the export data also maintains a good momentum. From January to August 2020, the cumulative export volume of titanium dioxide was close to 780,000 tons, a significant year-on-year increase of 18.36%. It is expected that the total export volume for the year will exceed 1.2 million tons, setting a new historical record. To be sure, the export to the international market is still a very important factor supporting the prosperity of titanium dioxide in the latter part of this year and in the future.As the price of titanium ore continues to run at a high level, the current price of titanium ore in Panxi has reached 298 usd/ton (EXW &amp; not VAT), causing the production costs of major domestic titanium dioxide producers to continue to increase, forcing titanium dioxide producers to continuously adjust their Product prices, coupled with the renewed large-scale outbreak of the global new crown virus, has caused overseas shipping prices to continue to skyrocket, which has caused the domestic titanium dioxide CIF prices to continue to rise, further reducing the price gap with international titanium dioxide suppliers. In addition, due to RMB since the second half of this year Continued appreciation, these reasons have had a certain impact on the export of titanium dioxide in early 2021, so we remain cautious about the export situation in early 2021. The current domestic titanium dioxide market situation: The supply of domestic titanium dioxide manufacturers is still very tight, basically every one has no inventory, and the supply to first-level agents has also been reduced by 20%-30%.

This article introduces how to choose titanium white pigments suitable for powder coatings. It is recommended to consider the following properties of titanium dioxide: (1) the type of titanium dioxide; (2) the surface treatment of titanium dioxide; (3) the particle size distribution of titanium dioxide; (4) pH value of titanium dioxide; (5) water content of titanium dioxide. Part 1: IntroductionWith the increase of environmental protection in China, the coating industry has gradually developed into high-solids coatings and water-based coatings. Powder coatings are representative of solvent-free high-solids coatings[1], and their volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions are much lower than traditional solvent-based coatings. Some products have achieved zero VOC emissions; It is an environmentally friendly coating that produces little solid waste during the coating process and prevents air pollution and fire. Powder coatings are made by uniformly mixing polymers such as polyester resin, polyurethane, polyacrylic acid, and epoxy resin with pigments, additives, etc. [2]. Powder coatings are easy to construct, generally only need one coating to meet the requirements of use. In the case of excellent coating process control, the film does not produce pores, acid and alkali resistance, corrosion resistance; powder coating equipment volume Small, small footprint, comprehensive investment of complete sets of equipment is smaller than traditional solvent-based coatings; powder coatings are not flammable, safer, convenient, simple and economical in use, storage and transportation; oversprayed coating powder can also be recycled and reused; Powder coatings have received extensive attention since the invention due to the above advantages. The coating process of powder coating can be divided into powder fluidized bed coating method, electrostatic spraying method, electrostatic oscillation method, currentized bed method, low-capacity electrostatic cloud chamber method, powder electrophoresis method and flame spraying method. The electrostatic powder coating method is currently the most widely used due to its high powder utilization rate, easy automation, and smooth coating on both the tip and the rough surface of the workpiece. Industries mainly based on powder coating include furniture manufacturing, home appliance kitchen manufacturing, steel pipe industry, automobile industry, agricultural machinery industry, fire equipment, motor industry and construction industry. Part 2: The natrure of titanium dioxideThe main component of titanium dioxide is TiO2, which is the best white pigment pigment [3-7]. Because of its higher refractive index, the ability to deflect light is greater than other white pigments, so it has better hiding power in coating applications. The refractive indices of common white pigments are shown in Table 1. The coating function prepared by titanium dioxide covers the substrate, beautifies the substrate, protects the substrate, and avoids the rust and corrosion of the substrate by the influence of light, heat and moisture. All in all, the basic performance of titanium dioxide in the industry is “coverage-beautification-protection”. Chart 1 Refractive index of common white pigments Material Refractive index Material Refractive index Titanium Dioxide Anatase 2.71 Basic lead carbonate 2.00 Titanium Dioxide Rutile 2.52 Basic lead sulfate 1.93 Zinc sulfide 2.37 Barium sulfate 1.64 Zinc oxide 2.02 Talcum powder 1.57 Part 3: The important role of titanium dioxide in powder coatingsIn the formulation design of powder coatings, the combination of resin and cross-linking agent is regarded as the direction that must be considered in the main performance of powder coating; therefore, the development of resin and cross-linking agent is devoted. But this does not mean that titanium dioxide is not so important, you can adjust and replace it. Titanium dioxide has an impact on the production, coating and film properties of powder coatings. In the production process, the dispersion of titanium dioxide directly affects the mixing effect, and also affects the dispersion of hot melt and the level of productivity in the extrusion processing. During the heat curing of the coating film, the surface properties of the titanium dioxide also affect the fluidity of the hot melt, the hardening speed and the yellowing which occurs during excessive baking. In terms of coating film performance, titanium dioxide affects the hiding power, gloss and weather resistance of the coating film. Therefore, when developing powder coatings, consider how to choose the right titanium dioxide. When using titanium dioxide, it is recommended to consider the following properties of titanium dioxide: (1) the type of titanium dioxide(2) the surface treatment of titanium dioxide(3) the particle size distribution of titanium dioxide(4) the pH of titanium dioxide(5) titanium dioxide Water content Types of titanium dioxideCommercial titanium dioxide can be divided into two categories: anatase and rutile titanium dioxide. The crystal characteristics and physical constants of titanium dioxide are shown in Table 2. Due to the difference in chemical structure, although it belongs to titanium dioxide, its performance is different. The coating is made of anatase titanium dioxide, which is prone to chalking in daylight. Compared with rutile titanium dioxide, the powdering resistance is better. Therefore, in the selection of titanium dioxide category, it is recommended to use rutile titanium dioxide.

For example, in order to express dispersibility, gloss is treated with hydrated alumina (aluminum hydroxide); in order to enhance weather resistance, surface treatment of hydrated silica and hydrated zirconia is performed. In order to enhance the wetting effect and the fluidity of the production, an organic surface of a polyol, an amine or a silane or a silyl ether is used.The whiteness of titanium dioxide is determined by the content of titanium dioxide in titanium dioxide; the more the surface treatment agent, the lower the content of titanium dioxide in titanium dioxide, thus affecting the whiteness of titanium dioxide. Therefore, it is desirable to have a higher whiteness when the powder coating film is applied, and it is more suitable to use a titanium white powder having a lower surface treatment agent content.In addition to the resin and formulation design, the surface coating of titanium dioxide also plays a supporting role.The surface coating treatment of alumina contributes to the dispersion of titanium dioxide in the resin system, thereby enhancing the optical properties of the titanium dioxide in the resin system, such as gloss, hiding power and the like. The crystallinity of alumina itself also contributes to the improvement of gloss. To design a semi-gloss or flat coating, choose a titanium dioxide powder with a silica treatment on the surface.Commercially available titanium dioxide has a surface treatment of alumina and silica. According to the functionality of gloss, there are so-called high-gloss titanium dioxide, glossy titanium dioxide and flat-light titanium dioxide.There are two ways to surface coat the silicon oxide.One is a loose adsorption type; after treatment, the surface structure is loose, the powder has a large particle size, the effective surface area is increased, and the oil absorption is high. In terms of functional performance, due to its loose structure, avoiding excessive crowding and creating a spatial effect, it contributes to the improvement of dry film hiding power.The other is a surface treatment of precipitation type; this method is to coat the silicon oxide tightly around the periphery of the TiO 2 particles, like a colored sugar coating outside the chocolate candy.Because of its compact structure, the structure of active titanium ions on the surface of TiO 2 and the polymer of the external environment are reduced, so that it does not cause yellowing, fading or chalking.Therefore, titanium dioxide can be divided into outdoor high weathering titanium dioxide and indoor titanium dioxide according to the degree of weather resistance. The TEM image of titanium dioxide coating without application is shown in Fig. 1. The characteristics of titanium dioxide can be distinguished from the treatment of surface coated oxides. However, the detailed surface coating chemical and structural properties must be discussed with relevant scientific and technical personnel to further understand how to select the appropriate titanium according to product design. White powder. Particle size distribution of titanium dioxideThe particle size of titanium dioxide determines the color tone of the film.Titanium dioxide is produced in order to produce optimum optical properties, often with particle sizes around 0.2 microns and particle size distributions from 0.15 to 0.3 microns. The smaller the particle size of titanium dioxide, the greater the degree of deviation of blue light, so the coating film will show a “blue-white” hue; if the particle size is larger, the hue tends to “yellow white”. Particle size and discoloration force are shown in Figure 2.However, sometimes the titanium dioxide powder is yellowed because the purification process is not ideal at the time of manufacture, and coloring impurities such as vanadium ions or iron ions remain in the titanium dioxide.Therefore, in the production of powder coatings, if a special hue is specified, it is recommended to pay attention to the particle size and distribution of titanium dioxide. In addition to the dispersion of titanium dioxide affects the coverage, the particle size of titanium dioxide also affects the hiding power, the trend is shown in Figure 3. The pH of titanium dioxideThe pH value of titanium dioxide generally has a significant effect on waterborne coatings; it affects the performance of system dispersants and tackifiers. Powder coatings must be considered depending on the free acid concentration or accelerator type of the resin selected.In the general acid-catalyzed process, the titanium powder with a high pH value neutralizes the catalyst, so that the hardening is incomplete and the hardness of the coating film is lowered.Titanium dioxide with a low pH value will accelerate the acid catalyzing effect, making the coating film harden too fast, which may easily cause surface defects of the coating film. Generally used at pH 7-8 is more suitable. The water content of titanium dioxideTitanium dioxide powder will absorb some of the moisture in the environment, resulting in an increase in water content.The increase of water content of titanium dioxide powder will cause poor dispersion, poor fluidity, bridging the conveying pipeline, and the surface of the coating film will easily cause wrinkles, pinholes, fisheye and other defects.The degree of adsorption of moisture by titanium dioxide is related to the concentration of the surface treatment agent. Generally, the titanium dioxide with high treatment content has a higher moisture absorption degree.Therefore, when storing materials, it is best to control the temperature and humidity of the environment. It is recommended that the warehouse temperature not exceed 27 ° C, the relative humidity does not exceed 75%, in order to avoid the risk of “powder dust explosion”, the facilities of the ventilation equipment can be strengthened to maintain air circulation and reduce indoor dust concentration.It is recommended that the water content of the powder (including titanium dioxide, filler and other powders) should not exceed 0.5%. Part 4: Method for evaluating the suitability of titanium dioxide in powder coatingsTitanium dioxide, like other raw materials, does not allow for all of the design requirements. It can be fully expressed in some characteristics, but it may have negative effects in other aspects, so the characteristics of the product must be considered when selecting titanium dioxide. In the evaluation of whether titanium dioxide is appropriate, it is often divided into three major properties to compare: Powder properties include: fineness distribution of powder, powder fluidity, gelation activity. The optical performance of the coating film includes: color, hiding power, gloss (20°, 60°), and degree of yellowing of excessive baking. Mechanical properties of the coating include: hardness test, solvent resistance test, flexibility test, impact test. Part 5: ConclusionPowder coating formulation design is often adjusted according to different needs.Resins, bridging agents, pigments, fillers and other additives are common in basic formulations. Titanium dioxide is also an important component in powder coatings. I hope that the narrative of this article can provide another perspective for research and development in the coating and titanium dioxide industries. For the production of titanium dioxide, the development of new titanium dioxide products, the application of titanium dioxide products in powder coatings has reference significance.

The reason for this is two-fold: TiO2 particles of the right size scatter visible light, having wavelength λ ≈ 380 - 700 nm, effectively because TiO2 has a high refractive index It is white because it does not absorb visible lightThe pigment is expensive, especially when volume prices of systems are used. Most paint and ink companies buy raw materials per weight and sell their products by volume. As TiO2 has a relatively high density, ρ ≈ 4 g/cm3, the raw material contributes substantially to the volume price of a system. Let’s learn more about this pigment starting with its scattering efficiency… Scattering by Solid ParticlesThe refractive index, represented by the letter n, of a material describes how light propagates through, and is bent by, that material. The magnitude of the refractive index, depending upon the electronic structure of the molecules, governs to what extent the path of light changes, when entering or leaving a material. Particles in a matrix, like pigment particles surrounded by the binder system in a coating, ink or plastic, can change the propagation direction of light when the particles and the matrix have a different refractive index. This phenomenon, called scattering, results in both white color (provided that the particles do not absorb visible light) and hiding power of the system. Scattering EfficiencyThe scattering efficiency of pigment particles in a system is governed by two key properties. Scattering is strong when the difference in refractive index of particle &amp; matrix, Δn = np - nm, is bigThe refractive index of binders used in coatings and inks is around 1.55. Titanium Dioxide is preferably used as scattering source because the pigment does not absorb visible light and it has a high refractive index. The size of the scattering particles is importantFor a specific wavelength of light, λ, there is an optimum with respect to particle size. Particles give maximum scattering efficiency when the diameter of the particles is about half the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation that is scattered. This implies that particles with a diameter of around 280 nm scatter visible light, with wavelength λ ≈ 380 - 700 nm, most efficiently. Continue reading to master your knowledge in TiO2 pigment, or simply click the specific segment you wish to explore more on:* The optimum PVC in TiO2 for efficient scattering Ways to optimize the use of TiO2 in paint and coatings formulations The 2 crystal structures of TiO2 used for paint &amp; coatings &amp; their photoactivity How to produce TiO2 pigment Selecting the Right Type of Paint Pigment Titanium Dioxide Alternative Materials to Obtain Scattering Pigment Volume ConcentrationThe properties of a system, like a coating, are governed by, amongst others, the loading of the system with solid particles. Particle loading is quantified by the property Pigment Volume Concentration (PVC). The PVC of a system is defined as the volume percentage of solid particles in the system after film formation has taken place: Vp: Total volume of all pigments in the systemVf: Total volume of all fillers in the systemVb: Volume of the non-volatile part of the binders in the system The definition implies that the PVC of a system is calculated by leaving the volatile components, like water and solvents, out. The volumes of the non-volatile components should be used, implying that weights must be transferred into volumes by using the density of each of the components. A system of high PVC has a high loading of solid particles and a system of low PVC contains a low amount of solid particles, as shown in the figure below: The TiO2 particles must be separated from each other and distributed uniformly over the system, in order to obtain optimum scattering of each primary titanium dioxide particle. Pigment particles hinder each other with respect to scattering when the particles are close to one another. The PVC of a system, especially the PVC in TiO2, is important with respect to the scattering efficiency of TiO2 particles. The distance between titanium dioxide particles goes down when the PVC in TiO2 goes up. At PVC in TiO2 of around 15%, the distance between the pigment particles becomes so small that particles start to interfere with each other. The scattering efficiency of each pigment particle becomes worse and worse when the PVC in titanium dioxide is increased between 15 and 30%. When the PVC in TiO2 is higher than about 30 volume%, the particles interfere so strongly that scattering power goes down when more TiO2 particles are added. This implies that: Adding titanium dioxide to paint in large quantity worsens both hiding power andwhite color strength when raising the PVC in TiO2 above 30%!With respect to the composition of a system that contains titanium dioxide pigment that is meant to give whiteness and hiding power because of scattering, the PVC in TiO2 should not exceed the threshold value of 30 volume-%. The total PVC, taking all solid particles into account, of a system can be (much) higher than 30%, as long as the PVC in TiO2 is below 30%. Ways to Optimize the Use of Titanium Dioxide for Paint IndustryOptimize the Dispersion ProcessEach primary TiO2 particle has to be used as efficiently as possible. TiO2 pigment scatters light most efficiently when all particles are separated from each and distributed over the system.A challenge in this respect is that solid particles attract each other strongly. This has two implications: A lot of work must be done to separate the particles from each other during the dispersion process. Separation is done by using high-energy dispersion equipment like: Disk disperser (often called dissolver), orPearl millThe shear forces in a dissolver set-up are too weak to separate all primary pigment particles from one another. More complete separation is obtained by using a pearl mill. The particles must be stabilized against flocculation. That is, the spontaneous gluing together of solid particles in a liquid caused by the attractive forces between the particles. Stabilization against flocculation is obtained by adsorbing a stabilizer, called dispersant, at the surface of the solid particles immediately after particles have been separated from each other.The dispersant assures that the particles repel each other. Thus, particles remain separated from each other. Two mechanisms can be used for this: Electrostatic stabilization: It results when all particles have an identical electrostatic charge. Steric stabilization: It results from polymeric tails, being part of the dispersant molecules, that dissolve in the liquid continuous phase surrounding the particles. Distribute the ParticlesThe scattering efficiency of expensive titanium dioxide pigment is maximized when all primary particles are separated from each other, stabilized against flocculation and distributed over the complete system. The distance between the individual pigment particles should be as large as possible. It is said that the pigment particles must be spaced in the system. Spacing can be obtained when TiO2 particles are combined with filler particles that have a comparable size. The filler particles do not scatter light but they prevent interference of the titanium dioxide particles. Crowding, the undesired grouping together of TiO2 particles, results when the pigment is combined with filler particles that are big, compared to the TiO2 particles. Optimum whiteness and hiding power of titanium dioxide pigment can be obtained by combiningthe pigment with the right dosage of filler particles with the right size.

Take the online course: TiO2 Optimization: Practical Formulation Strategies today to learn how to achieve best cost/performance ratio while working with TiO2. Crystal Structures of Titanium DioxideTitanium dioxide particles are crystalline. The individual chemical units of titanium dioxide, TiO2, can be stacked in several ways, giving different crystal structures. Mainly two crystal structures of titanium dioxide are used for pigments: anatase and rutile. The two crystal structures have an identical chemical composition, but the spatial orientation of the TiO2 units in the crystal lattice differs. Because of this difference, the two materials differ slightly in properties like density, Moh hardness, and refractive index. The density of titanium dioxide in paint depends on the type and amount of post-treatment. Anatase TiO2 has a lower hardness than rutile, implying that anatase particles are less abrasive and therefore give less wear of equipment. This is beneficial for some applications. Rutile titanium dioxide has the highest scattering efficiency because rutile TiO2 has a higher refractive index than anatase. Photo Activity of TiO2Titanium dioxide particles hardly absorb visible light. However, TiO2 particles do absorb UV radiation, for example from sunlight. Chemical reactions take place at the surface of a TiO2 particle when UV light is absorbed. It is said that titanium dioxide is photoactive. Radicals, chemical substances of high reactivity, are formed when UV radiation is absorbed in the surface of a titanium dioxide particle. The radicals can induce chemical reactions in which the polymers in the system are broken down. This phenomenon is highly undesirable, as it breaks the system down upon exposure to sunlight. Such a system is said to have a poor weathering resistance or that it has a poor outdoor durability. Post-treatmentPhotocatalytic degradation of a system containing titanium dioxide pigment is prevented by post-treating the pigment particles. By doing so, the photoactive TiO2 core of each pigment particle is shielded and photochemical breakdown of the binder system by radicals is prevented. Alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2) and zirconia (ZrO2) are the main inorganic post-treatments used for titanium dioxide pigments. The amount and quality of post-treatment govern how suitable the pigment is to be used for systems, like coatings, inks, and plastics, that are exposed to sunlight. Depending on the post-treatment, the surface of TiO2 particles can either be dense or porous. Next to inorganic post-treatment, a low percentage of organic material is used in the final steps of the production process of titanium dioxide pigment. The main objective of organic post-treatment, often consisting of alcohols, is to improve the dispersibility of the pigment. An effective organic post-treatment assures that it is easier to separate the primary particles from each other during the dispersion process. Production of TiO2 PigmentA few processes are used to produce TiO2 pigment. Rutile TiO2 is found in nature. This is because the rutile crystal structure is the thermodynamically stable form of titanium dioxide. In chemical processes natural TiO2 can be purified, thus obtaining synthetic TiO2. TiO2 pigment can be made from ores, rich in titanium, that are mined from the earth. Two chemical routes are used to make both rutile and anatase TiO2 pigments. In the sulfate process, the titanium-rich ore is reacted with sulfuric acid, giving TiOSO4. Pure TiO2 is obtained from TiOSO4 in several steps, going via TiO(OH)2. Depending on the chemistry and route chosen, either rutile or anatase titanium dioxide is made.In the chloride process, crude titanium-rich starting material is purified by converting titanium to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) by using chlorine gas (Cl2). The titanium tetrachloride is then oxidized at high temperature, giving pure rutile titanium dioxide. Anatase TiO2 is not made via the chloride process.In both processes, the size of the pigment particles as well as the post-treatment is adjusted by fine-tuning the final steps in the chemical route. Selecting the Right Type of Paint Pigment Titanium DioxideThe properties and behavior of titanium dioxide, as discussed above, should be taken into consideration when a TiO2 pigment must be chosen. A pigment with the right crystal structure should be selected. Rutile TiO2 scatters visible light most efficiently because of the high refractive index: nrutile = 2.75. The particles must have the right size. The average primary particle diameter, called d-50, should be around 280 nm for the optimum scattering of visible light. The amount and composition of the inorganic post-treatment should be chosen correctly with respect to the application. The type and amount of post-treatment of the pigment govern the degree of photoactivity. For outdoor durable coatings, for example, rutile TiO2 grades with a high percentage of alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2) and/or zirconia (ZrO2) should be used.These three selection criteria can be checked easily as, in general, crystal structure, average particle size and type and amount of inorganic post-treatment can be found in the technical documentation, as provided by the pigment producer. There are a few attention points that are less easy to check. The particle size distribution (PSD) of the pigment, for example, should be narrow with the maximum at d ≈ 280 nm. Also, the pigment should contain a low amount of aggregates, primary particles glued or fused together so strongly that they will not be separated when using conventional dispersion equipment, like a dissolver or bead mill. The primary particles should be easy to separate. In technical documentation, this is often referred to as easy dispersible. Both the degree of aggregation and the dispersibility are governed by the production process of the titanium dioxide supplier. Anatase TiO2 has the disadvantage of scattering visible light less efficiently than rutile TiO2. On the other hand, anatase particles have a lower Moh hardness than rutile particles, implying that anatase gives less abrasion of equipment. Often titanium dioxide pigments made via the sulfate process tend to be a little bit more yellow than pigments made via the chloride process. In practice, this slight color difference is hardly visible in complete systems. TiO2 NanoparticlesIn most systems, titanium dioxide in paint industry is used as a white pigment, giving high white color strength as well as hiding power, called opacity. TiO2 absorbs UV radiation effectively, especially when the pigment particles are small. Small particles have a high specific surface area and are therefore effective in absorbing radiation. Nano-sized post-treated titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) pigments, with rutile crystal structure and particle diameter of around 10 nm, are used as UV absorber in systems ranging from coatings to sun creams. A coating containing nano-TiO2 is transparent because the particles do hardly scatter visible light. However, in most coatings UV protection is assured by using organic additives, like UV absorbers in combination with radical scavengers. Substitute for Titanium Dioxide in PaintTitanium dioxide in paint industry can be combined with other materials that scatter visible light to obtain extra scattering efficiency. A precondition for such a material is that it has a refractive index that differs substantially from the refractive index of the binder system surrounding the particles. Preferably, it is possible to distribute the material as particles with a diameter of around 300 nm in the system. It turns out that there is only one real practical option: the use of air, having a refractive index n = 1.00. Air particles in a system do not absorb visible light and they give both a white color as well as hiding power. Apart from that, stable air particles of the right size can act as effective spacers for the TiO2 particles.Particle↔Matrix|Δn–|–:Rutile TiO2 ↔ Matrix|1.20Air ↔ Matrix|0.55 Air particles do not scatter visible light as effectively as TiO2 particles, even when air is well distributed in the matrix as particles with the optimum diameter. The reason is that the difference in refractive index of TiO2 and binder matrix is bigger than the difference in refractive index of air and binder matrix. There are several ways to introduce air particles in a coating. An approach that is often used is to load the system with such a high amount of solid particles that there is insufficient binder in the system to cover all the solid particles and to fill the spaces between the solid particles. Then, air voids form during film formation when water and/or solvent evaporates from the system. Another option is to use fillers that have air bubbles encapsulated within the particles. Flash-calcined kaolin is a filler that was treated with heat in such a way that closed pores are formed in each solid particle. An approach used to assure that stable air particles of the right size are introduced in the system is to use hollow polymeric filler. After film formation, the filler particles consist of an air core in a shell of polymer. The size of the whole particle, as well as the thickness of the shell of each particle, is such that the air within the particles gives optimal light scattering. Apart from this, hollow filler particles of the right size arrange spacing of the pigment particles. Use the Concepts in PracticePractice shows that often a lot of money can be saved when titanium dioxide pigment is used to give whiteness and hiding power to a coating, especially by: Improving the separation process, and/or Changing the type or amount of dispersantIt is worth the effort to study your system and try to find out whether the primary TiO2 particles in your system are: Separated from each other Stabilized sufficiently against flocculation, and Distributed wellA possible next step might be to study whether any options are available to introduce or improve spacing of the TiO2 particles in your system.

According to the latest research report of Guotai Junan Securities, the global energy shortage is a foregone conclusion, coal prices are still expected to rise more than expected in October, and the gap of thermal coal in the dynamic peak season will be further enlarged. At the same time, on the evening of October 7th, an emergency notice from Inner Mongolia on accelerating the release of some coal mine capacity circulated on the Internet. This morning, the hot coal stocks and power stocks collapsed. The largest flood peak in 40 years, the suspension of railroad tracks, tens of thousands of people were transferred, 126 mines were closed!Following the heavy rains in Henan, Shanxi suffered heavy rainfall. According to news from China Weather Network on October 7th, during the National Day holiday this year, Shanxi was hit by heavy rainfall. Among the 117 counties (cities, districts) in the province, 18 counties (cities, districts) had precipitation exceeding 200 mm, and precipitation in many places broke. Record in early October. Data shows that from 20:00 on the 2nd to 20:00 on the 6th, most areas of Taiyuan, Yangquan, Linfen, Changzhi, Lvliang, and Jinzhong set a record of accumulated rainfall in the first ten days of October. Heavy rainfall has caused waterlogging, geological disasters, floods and other disasters in many places. Shanxi Province has launched a level III emergency response to geological disasters. *** Affected by the heavy rain, as of 8 o’clock on October 4, Shanxi had transferred a total of 10,704 people, suspended production of 27 coal mines, 99 non-coal mines, 7 hazardous chemical enterprises, suspended construction of 231 projects in progress, and closed 74 scenic spots.*** Shanxi has regained its status as the largest coal-producing province Increased pressure on coal supply under heavy rainfall Since the end of August, power supply shortages have occurred in many parts of the country, and power restrictions and production restrictions have also occurred from time to time. As the main force of domestic power supply, coal-fired power generation is limited due to the tight coal supply and demand and restrictions on thermal coal prices repeatedly hitting historical highs. In the context of the current thermal coal market, which is already tight in supply and demand, more than 20 coal mines in Shanxi Province have been closed due to flood control needs, triggering concerns that the thermal coal market will have a larger gap after the holiday. Shanxi Province is the largest coal-producing province in China, with over 600 coal mines announced in the province. In the “Announcement on the Production Capacity of the Province’s Production Coal Mines” published by the Shanxi Provincial Energy Bureau on September 6, a total of 682 coal mines are listed, including some coal mines that have been cancelled (recoverable), with an annual production capacity ranging from several hundred thousand tons to two thousand tons. Ranging from ten million tons. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2020, the total output of raw coal above designated size nationwide will be 3.84 billion tons, an increase of 0.9% year-on-year; among them, the output of raw coal in Shanxi Province in 2020 will be 1.063 billion tons, becoming the second annual output of raw coal in domestic history to exceed 1 billion. Ton province, and surpassed Inner Mongolia in terms of output, becoming the country’s largest coal-producing province again. As a major domestic coal producer, Shanxi Province has recently undertaken the task of ensuring coal supply in the fourth quarter in more than a dozen provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. According to Xinhua News Agency, on September 29, the fourth quarter coal mid-to-long-term contract signing meeting for the 14 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in Shanxi Province was held in Taiyuan, Shanxi. In accordance with relevant requirements, the central coal enterprises in Shanxi will guarantee supply to 5 provinces and cities including Tianjin, Fujian, Hebei, Guangdong and Liaoning, and Jinneng Holding Group will connect with 6 provinces, regions and cities including Guangxi, Jiangsu, Jilin, Anhui, Shanghai, and Zhejiang; Shanxi Coking Coal Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Henan Province; Huayang New Material Technology Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Hainan Province; Lu’an Chemical Group undertakes the task of guaranteeing supply in Shandong Province, and the remaining tasks of guaranteeing supply are undertaken by coal companies in Shanxi Province. According to the 21st Century Business Herald, Meierya Futures believes that the 27 coal mines in Shanxi that will stop production may cause a bigger gap after the holiday, and the coal industry’s capacity contraction is superimposed on the dual control of energy consumption and increased demand. Time seems hard to see signs of improvement. The latest research report of Guotai Junan also stated that the global energy shortage is a foregone conclusion, coal prices are still expected to rise more than expected in October, and the gap of thermal coal in the dynamic peak season will be further enlarged. According to the China Fund News, some institutions said that during the National Day, more than 20 coal mines in Shanxi were closed due to flood control, which may cause a larger gap after the holiday. Although there are sporadic imports of coal into Hong Kong, the effect remains to be seen. In terms of imported Mongolian coal, it is still difficult to increase Mongolian coal in the later period, which is relatively supportive for high-priced coking coal. The follow-up focus will be on the progress of the reduction of crude steel, the extent to which it affects the demand for bi-coke, and whether the thermal coal supply policy can increase the supply of coal blending.","link":"/2021/10/11/China-Coal-Hub-Suspends-Mines-After-Floods-During-Energy-Crisis/"},{"title":"LB group leads another price increasing trend.","text":"LB Group issued an announcement on the evening of October 12th.

Kenmare Resources plc (“Kenmare” or “the Company” or “the Group”)14 October 2021Q3 2021 Production Report Kenmare Resources plc (LSE:KMR, ISE:KMR), one of the leading global producers of titanium minerals and zircon, which operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the “Mine” or “Moma”) in northern Mozambique, is pleased to provide a trading update for the quarter ending 30 September 2021 (“Q3 2021”). Statement from Michael Carvill, Managing Director: “Q3 2021 represents the first quarter of ilmenite production at nameplate capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum, an 87% increase on the production achieved in Q3 2020. Despite expected lower grades in Q4, we remain confident in the outlook for 2021 annual production and re-iterate our guidance of 1.1-1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite. Whilst we continue to remain vigilant against the threats posed by COVID-19, I am pleased to report that over 90% of our employees have now received two doses of vaccine. I’m also delighted to report that this quarter’s record production was achieved with no Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) and, in the past few days, we’ve achieved a new company record of 5 million man hours worked without an LTI. Market conditions for all products remained strong in Q3 2021 with pricing strengthening quarter on quarter, a robust order book in place and positive outlook across markets.” Q3 2021 overview Improved Lost time injury frequency rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.08 per 200,000 hours worked to 30 September 2021 (30 September 2020: 0.29), zero lost time injuries recorded during the quarter More than 90% of Mine employees have now received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 413,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, a 60% increase compared to Q3 2020, in line with expectations Ilmenite production of 314,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, an 87% increase compared to Q3 2020, the first full quarter’s production at nameplate capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite, setting a new record Primary zircon production of 15,700 tonnes, representing a 44% increase compared to Q3 2020, benefitting from increased HMC production Total shipments of finished products of 322,600 tonnes, a 173% increase compared to Q3 2020 Guidance for 2021 reiterated at 1.1-1.2 million tonnes of ilmenite, plus associated by-prodcuts Demand for Kenmare’s products remained robust in Q3 2021, supporting strong sales volumes and further price increases Operations update Table-Operational results for the Moma Mine in Q3 2021 were as follows Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate. Kenmare’s rolling 12 month lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the 12 months to 30 September 2021 was 0.08 per 200,000 man-hours worked (30 September 2020: 0.29), with no LTIs recorded in Q3 2021. 4.9 million LTI free hours worked completed by the end of Q3 2021. HMC production was 413,400 tonnes in Q3 2021, a 60% increase compared to Q3 2020 (258,000 tonnes) due primarily to a combination of higher tonnes of ore excavated due to a full period of WCP B mining in this period and higher grades. Ore grades in Q3 2021 were 4.83%, up 35% on Q3 2020 (3.58%) as a result of WCP B mining in the Pilivili zone. As previously announced, grades are expected to fall to ~3.8% in Q4 2021, before normalising at around 4.1% for 2022. Production of all finished products increased substantially in Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020. This was due to a 64% increase in HMC consumption, benefitting from higher HMC availability. Ilmenite production was 314,400 tonnes, representing an 87% increase compared to Q3 2020 (167,900 tonnes), higher than the increase in HMC consumption, benefitting from increased ilmenite content in the HMC and improved recoveries relative to Q3 2020. Primary zircon production was 15,700 tonnes, representing a 44% increase compared to Q3 2020 (10,900 tonnes), lower than the increased HMC consumption, due to lower zircon contained in the HMC (particularly at WCP B) and a temporary increase in intermediate stockpiles. Rutile production was 2,700 tonnes, a 69% increase (Q3 2020: 1,600 tonnes) as the recovery improvement programme delivered positive results. Concentrates production was 11,900 tonnes, a 32% increase compared to Q3 2020 (9,000 tonnes), reflecting a temporary increase in secondary zircon intermediate stock. Kenmare shipped 322,600 tonnes of finished products during the quarter, which represents a 173% increase compared to Q3 2020 (118,000 tonnes), as steady shipments were made through the period. This comprised 283,400 tonnes of ilmenite, 18,800 tonnes of primary zircon, 3,600 tonnes of rutile and 16,800 tonnes of concentrates. Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q3 2021 was 21,000 tonnes, compared with 34,300 tonnes at the end of Q2 2021. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q3 2021 was 186,300 tonnes, compared to 164,100 tonnes at the end of Q2 2021. Capital projects update The ramp up of the HMC pumping system from Pilivili has continued to progress. Less road haulage was required in the quarter and is now being wound down. The overall forecast capital cost for the WCP B project remains in line with prior guidance of US$127 million. The Rotary Uninteruptible Power Supply (RUPS) project has moved into the execution phase with civil engineering and building construction underway. Fabrication of the RUPS units is complete and transportation to site is underway. The project is expected to be completed in Q1 2022. Work on the Nataka Prefeasibility Study (PFS) continues. Detailed orebody investigations are progressing well with a view to optimally mining with WCP A at Nataka from 2025. It is expected that the PFS will be finalised in 2022. Market update Demand for Kenmare’s products remained robust in Q3 2021, supporting strong sales volumes and further price increases. The recovery in the downstream titanium markets continued, supporting high utilisations at pigment plants globally and strong demand from titanium metal producers. In 2021, despite an increase in the supply of ilmenite from mines in China and concentrate products from Mozambique, the market has continued to be tight. Positive momentum continued in Q3 2021, as demand for ilmenite product to upgrade into high-grade feedstocks continued to grow strongly in China. The outlook for Q4 2021 remains positive, with a strong order book in place. The Company continues to monitor the impact of power disruption to downstream industries in China, and the potential effect on demand related to the uncertainty in the Chinese real estate market. However, demand remains strong from our customers in China, and elsewhere, into Q4 and global feedstock inventories remain at low levels. Demand for zircon improved in Q3 2021, as major economies continued the recovery from COVID-19 restrictions being lifted. Demand from the ceramics and foundry industries has recovered particularly quickly. In China, Kenmare’s zircon concentrate benefited from a tight spot market. Coupled with supply disruptions, the strong demand has resulted in an undersupplied market and prices for zircon are expected to increase again in Q4 following increases in Q2 and Q3.

In order to implement the work deployment of the National Standing Committee, on October 12, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the “Notice on Further Deepening the Market-oriented Reform of Coal-fired Power Generation On-grid Tariffs” to clarify four important reforms: First, the orderly liberalization of all coal-fired power generation electricity On-grid electricity prices; the second is to expand the range of fluctuations in market transaction electricity prices, and expand it to “in principle, the fluctuations do not exceed 20%”, and the market transaction prices of high energy-consuming enterprises are not subject to the 20% rise; the third is to promote industrial and commercial users to enter the market; The fourth is to maintain stable electricity prices for residents, agriculture, and public welfare undertakings. The new regulations have been implemented since October 15th, a new round of electricity price reform has begun, and China’s electricity market reform has taken another important step. According to incomplete statistics from the official accounts of the power trading centers in various regions, three days after the start of the electricity price reform, many places have organized their first transactions after deepening the market-oriented reform of coal power on-grid tariffs. Among them, the transaction price of Jiangsu and other provinces has risen by nearly 20%. However, Yunnan, Guangxi and other provinces have risen by up to 50%. The increase in industrial electricity prices and the rise of electricity prices in high-energy-consuming industries are not restricted. On the one hand, it will increase the cost of chemical companies to a certain extent, prompting companies to pass on the pressure by increasing prices; On the other hand, high-energy-consuming chemical companies will also reduce cost pressures through autonomous “orderly use of electricity”, changing from passive power outages to active power outages, which will also have a continuous impact on the operating rate of enterprises.

The quantity is arround 100k-120k tons in total. Will the production limits policy break the balance of the supply-needs background? Not likely. Even there might be 100k-120k tons outputs will be cut, but the spring is always the off-season in tio2 market. Traditionally, the manufactures were likely to spend 15-20days for maintainance during spring. ExplainSo, why do they do it? To follow up with global trend, the international plays such as Kronos, Tronox, Venator, Chemours, and more announced their increase will effect on in Jan 1st. 2022. After Jan 1st, 2022, there will be more users shifting to China SP grades tio2. Last several monthes, the Western CP grades in western world was in shortate meanwhile the China SP grades price is catching up with the western CP in Asia pacific, africa and many other regions. The increasing price of China SP in some degree enlarge the needs of Western CP grades. But with the official increasing of the western CP grades price, the price gap between China and Western tio2 will be again enlarged. So the Chinese manufactures do belive that there could be another chance of the increasing. But will it come out as they expected? ForcastingIt is the last radiance of the setting sun. Since the mid of Oct. 2021 the market is in chill. The manufacturers did not get orders abundant enough as they did in the first half of this year. Some of them even start to reducing the price to test the market. And there are still no new booming of the orders. The cost is not incresing, this time the increase is not stand on a solid ground. All the announced increasing is effected on Jan 1st. 2022 instead of next week or immediately as they did before. So they are more likely testing the market other than determined increasing. So we do have reasons to believe that after the Chinese New Year, without seeing orders booming, the decrease will start sliently. And trust me, more and more suppliers will start to contact you actively.All in all, buy in needs.","link":"/2021/12/14/Is-it-the-last-radiance-of-the-setting-sun-LB-followed-the-increase-trend/"},{"title":"Africa&#39;s first titanium dioxide plant is scheduled to be completed and put into operation in 2023","text":"A few days ago, South Africa Nyanza Light Metal Mining Company announced that it will invest 4.5 billion rand (about 280M USD) to build Africa’s first titanium beneficiation plant and produce titanium dioxide.

They are only one link in the construction of the logistics economy - the huge logistics chain is undergoing an unprecedented major test. Master Wei was wearing blue slippers and walking in the middle of the road. There were no moving cars on the road, nor could he hear any traffic or whistles. Every time he took a step, he could hear the rubbing of slippers and pebbles on the ground. The crickets in the open space on the side are also very lively. If you listen carefully, you can even find a few frog calls from the sound of the crickets. This is the 12th day that Master Wei stayed in Shanghai, and the first night he moved to the roadside of Jingdong Road, Minhang District, Shanghai. On March 28, Master Wei and two other truck drivers drove three vehicles, carrying nearly 100 tons of potatoes, from Laiwu, Jinan, to Shanghai. The plan of the three of Master Wei is to arrive in Shanghai in the early morning of the 29th, and after pulling the goods to the designated vegetable wholesale market, they will unload the truck and return, and they will be able to go home after two or three days. However, this plan came to an abrupt end after arriving in Shanghai in the early morning of the 29th. “The 29th is still normal, the 30th is basically half blocked, and the 31st is basically closed.” Master Wei told “Chinese Entrepreneurs”. In the past, Master Wei also often traveled to Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, but most of them were general goods such as construction site building materials and raw materials. This was the first time he shipped vegetables to Shanghai. “This Shanghai epidemic, there are fewer people pulling food here, and the shipping fee is a little higher, so we came here.” Master Wei told us that the shipping fee is about 2,000 yuan higher than before. Usually, there is no free high-speed fee when going to Shanghai. One round trip can earn more than 3,000 yuan, and this time, it can earn more than 5,000 yuan. Like the flow of water in a high-pressure water gun, the truck drivers are a group of invisible beings. They circulate on highways all over the world, and get paid by settlement. From the departure point to the destination, they pass through one highway intersection and service area one after another. In the ETC era, they don’t even have to meet the staff of the artificial window. Fast through toll booths in minutes. Occasionally encountering toll booths that require manual ticket sales, they just roll down the windows, hand over the money, and get the tickets back. All they do is mileage, speed and destination.Now, high-pressure water guns are turned into untightened faucets. On April 8, Hangzhou issued a “Notice on Temporary Closure of Passage Measures at Some Expressway Toll Stations in Hangzhou”. 24 hour closing measures. It is understood that Hangzhou has closed 13 expressway toll stations including the Yuanpu exit of the Ring Expressway, the Huanghu exit of the Hangzhou-Changzhou Expressway, and the Zhangjiafan (in front of the institute) exit of the Hangjinqu Expressway. In addition to Hangzhou, Shanxi, Shaoxing, Huainan, Hefei, Kunshan, Suqian, Xuzhou, Taizhou, Qingdao, Xi’an, Jinzhou, Shenyang and many other places have successively issued similar announcements, that is, due to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, some local expressways will be temporarily closed. toll. In addition to the closure of some expressways, Zhongshan, Hangzhou and other places have also issued notices to strengthen the management of epidemic prevention and control of truck drivers. Some truck drivers were trapped in Shanghai for delivering supplies, some were blocked on highways, and some were quarantined at home because they had just returned to a medium-high-risk place. They are only one link in the construction of the logistics economy - the huge logistics chain is undergoing an unprecedented major test. After being trapped for 12 days, use potatoes to count the days“This is our car, this is the stove we use to make the fire, and this is the broken wood picked up from other people’s construction sites.” Master Wei showed us his current living area one by one - an open-air kitchen on the sidewalk. The place where Master Wei builds a fire and eats. Source: Respondents The stove was remodeled from a paint bucket, and a large square was cut at the bottom. In order to make the pot stand and keep it stable, the mouth of the bucket was shaped like a petal. After several days of use, the interior of this remodeled stove has been smoked black, and the white paint stains on the outside have turned yellow. The 39-year-old Master Wei is from Jining, Shandong Province. He speaks fast and expresses directly. When introducing this open-air kitchen, he kicked the item being introduced. I don’t know that this is an attempt to make us see more clearly and intuitively. , I still have grievances about this pot and this stove - during this period of time in Shanghai, I ate two meals a day, and most of the time I ate boiled potatoes in water. After the three of them arrived in Shanghai with nearly 100 tons of potatoes, they did not expect the vegetable market to be closed. So, who to give these potatoes to, how to unload them, and where should they go during this time have become problems. This batch of potatoes was bought by Boss Xia in Shandong, and Master Wei took the order. Master Wei has been driving a truck for more than ten years. In the past, he drove a 6-meter-8 trolley. Three years ago, he replaced it with the current 13-meter-long trailer. This truck is full of more than 30 tons of potatoes. On March 29, after learning about the closure of the vegetable market, Master Wei and his party were arranged to be in a warehouse rented by Boss Xia. This warehouse is located in Minhang District, Shanghai, next to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport. It is an Audi warehouse. The restaurants, supermarkets, and shops here have all closed, and you can only rely on yourself to eat and drink. On the afternoon of April 7, Master Wei and his party stopped at a warehouse in Minhang District, waiting for the last truck of potatoes to be unloaded. Source: Respondents In the first two days of arriving in Shanghai, Master Wei and his party still had some stored food, but the three adult men had three meals a day, and they ate them in three or four days. On April 3, Boss Xia entrusted two handfuls of noodles, oil and salt to be delivered. At that time, they had already eaten up their own stored food, so they began to eat this batch of potatoes shipped from Shandong, which was boiled without oil. Eat, you can fry and eat when there is oil. On the afternoon of April 7, on the 10th day of being trapped in Shanghai, Mr. Wei’s potatoes in his car were all sold out, and there were still a whole carload of potatoes in the car of his friends, some of which were about to sprout. On the night of the 11th day of being trapped, nearly 100 tons of potatoes were sold out in three trucks. “It didn’t work in the first few days. There were only a few boxes of goods a day, and it didn’t even move for a few days. It was better when it arrived on the sixth or seventh day. It was more than 100 boxes for a pull.” Master Wei said. In the early morning of the 12th day of being trapped, Boss Xia withdrew from the warehouse, and they drove to the road more than 20 kilometers away from the warehouse, waiting for the lockdown to be lifted. Boss Xia, who never showed up, left two boxes of potatoes for Master Wei and the others, about 100 pounds in total, and some noodles. “There aren’t many noodles, so we’ll eat it sparingly.” Now the three eat twice a day, the first at around 10 am and the second at around 3 pm. Judging from the current food, Master Wei estimates that it is about It can last six or seven days. There are more than three people trapped in this Audi warehouse at the same time as Master Wei. Master Wei introduced that Boss Xia is from Anhui, and Boss Xia’s fellow villagers also pulled two trucks of goods and entered Shanghai at this special point, but they started from Hefei. During the waiting period, the number of drivers stranded here changed from 3 to 5, but we didn’t communicate much, just chatting occasionally. In fact, Master Wei and other truck drivers have tried various channels to apply for a pass. “A friend who can apply for a pass in the circle of friends is just joking, and no one can get a pass for Shanghai. “ “My wife is on the phone with me every day, and it’s useless to worry.” When asking questions about family members, Master Wei’s speech rate will slow down. There are 6 people in Master Wei’s family. He is the pillar of the family and the main source of income for the whole family. “We don’t know when we can go back.” Master Wei told us when contacted again on the evening of the 9th. On the afternoon of April 8, we called Boss Xia to learn more about the situation. He told us that he has been taken to the makeshift hospital, and it is inconvenient to disclose other things. Master Wei told us that after eating potatoes for two or three days, Boss Xia was quarantined - Master Wei had already started counting the days when he went home with potatoes. A Fantastic Drift of an Auto Parts SampleAbout ten kilometers away from Master Wei, Liu Ronghui (pseudonym), who is located in Shanghai Pudong New Area, is isolated at home. This is the 17th day of his detention, and it is unknown how many days he is working from home. “As a dead fat house, I didn’t lose weight by exercising every day. This time, I kept it at home, giving non-staple food to the elderly and children, and giving snacks to my wife. I went out to volunteer from time to time to help, and I lost 8 pounds…” Where can I buy in groups, and where can I grab food? How to stabilize my daughter when her homework is decreasing day by day? How to answer the customer’s urging, how to online, as much as possible to ensure the supply? For nearly a month, these three questions have plagued him alternately. “I have used all my papering skills in my life, but I am still riddled with holes.” Liu Ronghui told us. (Note: The paper craftsman was originally a paper-paper worker. Li Hongzhang also mocked himself as a paper-paper craftsman. Later, this statement was gradually extended in East China. There were beautification and patchwork, but there was no way to solve the core problem. mean.) After 1985, Liu Ronghui worked for a well-known parts manufacturer in Shanghai, with customers all over the world. “Basically all mainstream car companies use my parts.” Liu Ronghui said. On March 14, Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province issued a notice to initiate a Level I emergency response. From now on, the city will completely suspend work, business, school, public places, and crowd gathering activities. At the same time, strict transportation control measures will be adopted throughout the city. In this case, the companies involved in the region will stop production, and the inter-provincial logistics and express delivery will also stop. However, the new project samples in charge of Liu Ronghui need to be assembled and sent from the factory in Pinghu. Pinghu City is a county-level city hosted by Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, next to Shanghai, where many world-renowned multinational companies, global industry leaders, chain-owner companies and benchmarking companies gather here. Automobiles, high-end machine tools and new materials are the advantages here. industry. According to the “China Economic Times” report: Pinghu City leverages the strong chain extension of the automobile industry with “chain master” enterprises. There are 272 auto parts companies, including 8 of the top 100 global auto parts companies such as ABB in Switzerland, GKN in the United Kingdom, and Lear in the United States. They have formed a complete industrial chain supporting capability of “production of the whole car in Pinghu”, and are associated with auto parts every year. The production capacity is more than 5 million units. At present, Great Wall Motors has more than 50 supporting enterprises in Pinghu. It is reported that Pinghu has become one of the largest new energy drive motor production bases in the country. The total output value of the automobile industry chain is expected to exceed 50 billion yuan within two years, and will reach a scale of 100 billion yuan in five years. “The car is not allowed to go directly to Shanghai.” Because the sealed samples cannot be sent directly to customers in other regions, and the trucks that customers collect goods cannot pick up the goods, Liu Ronghui’s “paper pasting” skills have been inspired. “First, I found a way to find a customer with a temporary correspondence certificate, took the samples out of the urban area, and sent a special car to the customer after thinking of the transit warehouse in Jiaxing City. I didn’t expect the logistics company there to say that it would not accept the order to Shanghai. The reason is very It’s simple, the return trip from Shanghai will require 14-day quarantine.” Faced with this situation, Liu Ronghui could only arrange a special logistics vehicle to the brother factory in Changzhou, Jiangsu, and then let other customers’ logistics vehicles that have not left Pinghu take the samples away. Completely bypasses Shanghai. On the evening of March 18, the samples finally arrived in Changzhou. But what made Liu Ronghui feel devastated was that a notice was issued on the same day, saying that 19 daily states would also have 3 days of closure and control management and nucleic acid of all staff. “The mood at that time was like a refugee who escaped from Hiroshima to Nagasaki in 1945.” Liu Ronghui said. Fortunately, the samples finally arrived in the hands of the customer. After seeing the news of the closure and control, major OEMs rushed to Changzhou before 24:00 on the 18th, towed away all the finished product inventory that could be towed away by the supplier, and took samples along the way. . “The industrial belt is going crazy. The Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are the main suppliers. The mainland of Changchun is an ecu supplier. Changchun has been closed for almost a month. It’s gone.” Liu Ronghui said. Companies such as Tesla and Weilai have been affected. On March 28, according to Reuters , Tesla plans to suspend the production activities of its super factory in Shanghai from March 28 for 4 days due to the impact of Shanghai’s epidemic prevention policy. Bloomberg also previously reported that Tesla’s Shanghai plant will stop production for at least one day starting on Monday (March 28). On April 8, Guotai Junan Futures wrote in a research report: Affected by the epidemic, the production of 550,000 tons of polyester bottle flakes in East China has recently been reduced to around 70%. Affected by the epidemic and logistics, some major polyester industrial yarn factories have reduced their production load or even stopped production this week, such as Yufu, Jinhuite and Wenlong have stopped production, and the load of Sunway and Sunfull has increased slightly. July 7), the overall theoretical start-up load of domestic polyester industrial yarn dropped to about 63%. In addition, Hilead’s current operating load is temporarily maintained, but the Haining area is controlled by the epidemic and cannot enter or leave the logistics. If there are not enough raw and auxiliary materials for Hilead and the logistics has not resumed, production must be reduced and stopped. On April 9, NIO issued a “Note on Recent Production and Delivery”. NIO said that since March, due to the epidemic, the company’s supply chain partners in Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu and other places have successively stopped production. It has not been restored yet. Affected by this, Weilai’s vehicle production has been suspended. Weilai said that the delivery of many users’ vehicles will be delayed in the near future. “I also ask for your understanding. The company will work with supply chain partners to resume production as soon as possible and deliver vehicles to everyone as soon as possible on the premise of meeting the requirements of epidemic prevention.” Drivers become in short supply “materials”As long as it can be delivered, regardless of the cost and transportation needs that do not consider the timeliness, logistics companies are also “papering”. On April 3, Gaopeng received a notice in the tenant communication group in the park. The notice reads: According to the spirit of the “Kunshan Epidemic Prevention and Control Announcement No. 24 in 2022”, each company will take a silent break from April 3 to April 6, and employees of the company will return to their place of residence to participate in regional nucleic acid testing. Gao Peng is the head of Huayuan World Logistics. The company is located in German Industrial Park, Zhangpu Town, Kunshan. Many precision machinery companies have settled in this park, such as Eisenmann China Automobile Assembly Line Production Base, Berger Precision Machinery Parts (Kunshan) Co., Ltd.; Jiangsu Changjiang Water Pump Co., Ltd.; and many logistics companies, such as DHL (Sinotrans) DHL). It is understood that Kunshan is a major production center for PCB, electronic foundry, panels, and notebook computer components. Nandian, Xinxing, AUO, Visionox, Longteng Optoelectronics, Shishuo, Compal, and Luxshare have factories in the area. . The main customers of Huayuan Tianxia Logistics are mostly electronic components, packaging consumables and mold products from nearby factories. “It hasn’t stopped since the New Year.” After seeing the notice, Gao Peng complained inwardly. But Tucao returned to Tucao, and the movements in his hands did not stop. Before the silence time came, Gao Peng and the others packed up the things that should be packed, and some colleagues who had come from Suzhou went back to Suzhou. It is understood that Huayuan World Logistics has two offices, one in Suzhou and the other in Kunshan. “Not long after the New Year, there was an epidemic in Suzhou. After Suzhou, Shanghai came out, and then there were sporadic epidemics in Hangzhou and Zhejiang, which have always been around us.” Gao Peng concluded with a wry smile. Master Gao is one of the hired drivers of Huayuan World Logistics. Unlike Master Wei, he is not personally affiliated. He is currently isolated at home and can still get the basic salary from the company. On March 9, Master Gao received a notice from the community and asked him to isolate at home because he went to Shanghai once at the end of February and has never been to Shanghai since. Now, this is the second time he has been quarantined because of the epidemic in Kunshan itself, and the quarantine period starts on April 1. “Since the outbreak of the epidemic, I have been in quarantine almost all the time, and I haven’t run much in the past two months. A colleague ran for a few days last month and has been in isolation.” Master Gao also told us that the company’s Kunshan side There are also seven or eight drivers, all of whom are in home quarantine. A suitable driver has become a shortage of “materials”. “For example, when you go to Henan, as long as you enter Henan, the green code will turn yellow (code). Henan is right in the middle of China, and many people who travel from south to north have to pass through Henan.” Gao Peng told us that after the epidemic in Shanghai became serious, Corresponding strict control measures have been issued in many places. These measures have become a sieve, and there are not many drivers who can stay. In order to ensure the smooth passage of living materials, the green pass issued by Henan Province. Source: Respondents Gao Peng told “Chinese Entrepreneurs” that many older drivers have a junior high school degree, or even less than a junior high school degree. It is very difficult to get a driver’s license. How to smoothly switch and use the health codes of various cities when crossing provinces and cities is a “threshold”. “For example, from Nanjing to Suzhou, Suzhou has the code of Suzhou, and Nanjing has the code of Nanjing. They may not be able to get it when they are old, but this must be done by themselves.” Gao Peng explained, “The isolation of isolation, the yellow code I can’t run, and it will take several days to change back for the next job, and those who don’t know how to use these health codes, the transport vehicles are seriously insufficient now.” In late March, Master Gao, who had just been released from the first quarantine, went out to deliver goods. “At that time, the local area in Kunshan required a blue label, a green label, and an orange label. I set up a blue label and planned to go from Kunshan to Suzhou on the high-speed.” The color label in Master Gao’s mouth is similar to the “truck version” of the health code. It is understood that on March 25, Kunshan City implemented the “Classification Management System for Trucks by Risk Level”, and applied “orange, blue and green” classification management signs for trucks based on the health information of truck drivers and passengers, and based on the “orange, blue, green” classification management system “Three-color signs for precise prevention and control. Blue indicates that there is a history of passing through low-risk areas outside Kunshan City, and the itinerary card does not have an asterisk. Recently, Mr. Gao got his salary for March, a total of more than 5,000 yuan. What is different from the past is that the income structure has changed from basic salary plus commission to basic salary plus subsidy. “To be honest, it’s not a lot, because it’s a total of four or five days of class.” Master Gao said. It is understood that in the logistics industry, many drivers who run long-distance trunk lines are paid by trip. For example, if you specially run from Beijing to Guangzhou, it will take four or five days for a round trip, and the intermediate loading and unloading will stay for one day. You can run three or four times a month, and the commission is the main source of income. Gao Peng reluctantly said: “It may be a month, two months of hard support, and only three months to pay the basic salary. Large companies may be fine, but small and micro enterprises like us basically can’t stand it all the time. “ Source: People’s Vision On the evening of April 7, Kunshan issued the No. 37 Circular on Epidemic Prevention and Control, and decided to extend the silence period for 4 days from 24:00 on April 8 to 24:00 on April 12, 2022. On April 8, AUO, a major panel manufacturer, issued an announcement stating that its Kunshan subsidiary will suspend work from April 8 to 12 in cooperation with the local government’s epidemic prevention and control policy. During the shutdown period, inventory will be allocated to reduce the impact on customers. Guanghua-KY, a car interior parts factory, pointed out that its subsidiary Xiangyang Guangjia has flexibly adjusted its production plan due to the suspension of production due to the tightening of epidemic control and logistics blockades in Shanghai, Wuxi and Kunshan for its main customers. At present, sufficient raw material inventory has been prepared to meet the production needs of customers after resumption of work. According to the Aijiwei APP, other Taiwanese factories that have announced the suspension of the Kunshan subsidiary include AUO, Xinxing, Baicheng, Lantian, Huafu, Anli-KY, Shanghua, etc. Compared with the material problems that can be perceived immediately, the B-side supply chain hiding behind the daily consumption of the public cannot be perceived at the first time. “Adding all kinds of time costs, the transportation cost will definitely be high. As far as I know, these companies will lose a part of the money if they send a truck of goods, and the freight will increase by nearly four or five times.” Gao Peng told us. wait for a reboundFor companies, transportation costs increase and production capacity is limited; for drivers, income decreases. “The congestion started around 12 o’clock, and there are still about 3 kilometers to reach the toll station. It is estimated that it will be blocked until 6:00 in the evening to get off the expressway.” On April 8, we got in touch with Master Deng. Among the drivers, and among the acquaintances and colleagues around the driver, the only one still running on the road. Master Deng mainly runs short and medium distances, mainly in Jiangsu. There are two main routes for frequent runs, Changzhou to Suqian and Changzhou to Xuzhou. He used to be an accountant in a factory mainly engaged in frozen chicken and duck agricultural products. Five or six years ago, the owner of the factory proposed to let him buy a car and help him pick up the goods. Master Deng started his career as a driver. At 6:00 in the morning of April 7th, Master Deng set out from Changzhou and arrived in Suqian at 4:00 in the afternoon. After loading the goods, he went back from Suqian. He slept in the service area at night. If it is not blocked, he should be home soon when we contact him. . In the mouth of truck drivers, roads are divided into “on the road” and “off the road.” The upper road is the expressway, and the lower road includes various national roads, provincial roads, and rural roads. Spanning hundreds of thousands of kilometers, except for large-scale logistics, few drivers will take high-speed all the way. Under the epidemic, in order to reduce the time stuck on the road, most of the drivers chose the high speed. “If you go down the road, there are checkpoints in every region and every county, and they are all checked. The congestion will be even worse, and you may not be able to get there for a few days. Only the exit of the expressway is blocked, and the others are unblocked.” Master Deng told us. Master Deng calculated an account for us: before the epidemic, it was about 4,000 yuan per order, and now it has increased by almost a few hundred, but it cannot reach the previous profit. Although the driver can get an extra subsidy of 500 yuan, it may cost 1,000 yuan to go on the highway. After all, the driver still earns 500 yuan less, and there are always traffic jams. The original cost, including fuel fees and high-speed charges, was about 2,000 yuan per trip, but now it’s about 3,000 yuan. This means that the price of a single trip has increased, but the profit and one-month income have fallen. “The outbreak of the epidemic in Shanghai was almost 10 times a month, but now it can only run about six or seven times. In the past month, the loss is nearly 10,000 yuan. It used to be about 20,000 yuan a month, but now I earn 10,000 yuan. Money is difficult.” Master Deng said. In addition to fewer trips and profits for drivers, the company is also cutting production. “Compared with the original, the company’s sales volume has decreased by about 30%. We are refrigerated, the shelf life is 12 months, and it is not affected by the weather very much. However, if it cannot be sold, the storage cost will increase, so we can only reduce production.” Master Deng, an accountant, keenly captured this change. It’s not just Mr. Deng’s company that has increased costs. “Recently, the Shanghai port is in a state of semi-paralysis. If the ship is not chartered, the freighter will jump to the port. If Shanghai is closed for two weeks, the freighter will first go to Fukuoka, Busan, and return after a month. The bulk parts are basically only safe stocks. Some small-volume materials can still be transshipped by the China-Europe Railway, and large-volume railway transportation costs are not worth the goods, so it is better to stop production.” Liu Ronghui told us that now OEMs are mainly eating inventory, and now physical goods and inventory are king. era. Zheng Cuntuan of China-Europe Qatar Airways told us: China-Europe Qatar Airways has been operating normally, and its sources of goods are mainly from Fujian, Guangdong. And the company’s business has grown significantly. It’s hard to tell where the current growth is coming from, though, and it will take two months to know. Because many customers are in urgent need to go to China-Europe Qatar Airways, the planned cargo (after six months) will go slowly by sea. As long as demand is there, the impact may be short-lived, and a rebound is just a matter of time. “Maybe this period of time will have a serious impact on some small and micro enterprises, but in the long run, if you give some economic stimulus, you should be able to survive. In 2020, we will also send epidemic prevention materials to Wuhan. The first half of the year is very difficult. Difficulties, the manufacturing and logistics industries in the second half of the year are soaring. “ Gao Peng said. “I believe that the vitality of the enterprise will not have much impact.” Zheng Cuntuan said. The stabilization and recovery of the supply chain has already begun. According to reports, on April 7, the Ministry of Transport held a meeting on the logistics guarantee coordination working mechanism. The National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Health and Health Commission and other members of the mechanism attended the meeting. The meeting emphasized that coordinating the work of epidemic prevention and control and logistics security is an important task to win the new round of epidemic prevention and control, and it is to ensure the safety and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain, and maintain the normal production and living order of the people. important foundation. The meeting pointed out that the problems of inadequate implementation of policies in some regions and overweighting at various levels still exist, and the problem of poor logistics operation in some epidemic-related regions such as the Yangtze River Delta is more prominent. The operation is smooth and the service guarantee for truck drivers is strengthened. On April 8, Xiao Yaqing, Minister of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that all efforts should be made to stabilize the production of enterprises and the smooth connection of the supply chain, strengthen the coordination of logistics, transportation and factor guarantees, open up blocking points, and ensure the smooth transportation of key materials and important products. On the evening of April 9, Master Wei was still counting potatoes on the side of the road, waiting to go home. We wanted to help him find some supplies to send as much as possible, but Master Wei refused, “Don’t bother, it’s all sealed here, it’s hard to get it, so don’t cause trouble for everyone.” @中国企业家杂志baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1729707066723417822&wfr=spider&for=pc @GoogleTranslatebaijiahao-baidu-com.translate.goog/s?id=1729707066723417822&wfr=spider&for=pc&_x_tr_sl=zh-CN&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp","link":"/2022/04/11/Truck-driver-Shanghai-rafting/"},{"title":"The epidemic has repeatedly blocked logistics. How much is the cost of logistics enterprises?","text":"Xinhua Finance, Shanghai, April 10 (Reporter Yang Youzong) The reporter saw in the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Pudong New District, Shanghai a few days ago that many container trucks were parked end to end on both sides of the road. These truck drivers can be as short as three to five days, or as long as they have no work to do for a week or two. Due to the control of the epidemic, it was difficult for some truck drivers to leave Shanghai, and the business volume shrank. The stranded truck drivers are a microcosm of the logistics obstruction caused by the epidemic. Since the current round of the epidemic, prevention and control measures have been upgraded in many places, and the travel of residents and the flow of goods have been affected to some extent. According to industry analysis, normalized prevention and control policies will increase the cost pressure of logistics enterprises, and will also make logistics industry practitioners face greater uncertainty. The logistics system of truck drivers stranded is affected In the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Pudong New District, Shanghai, the reporter saw trucks with Shanghai E, Shanghai F and Su E license plates parked on the side of the road on Gangjian Road, Shendong Road and other roads. Go to bed, or make phone calls anxiously. The driver Guo Liutao, a native of Shenqiu County, Zhoukou City, Henan Province, is 32 years old this year. He has been working as a truck driver for two years, and usually runs the Yangtze River Delta route. “I stopped in Shanghai on April 3, and it has been 4 days now. I have food and lodging in the car. I haven’t worked for 4 days. It turned out to be more than 200 yuan for one trip a day. Now I can’t make any money. The boss doesn’t make any money either.” Shanghai has one of the busiest ports in the world. Data show that in 2021, the container throughput of Shanghai Port will exceed 47 million TEUs, ranking first in the world for 12 consecutive years. Shanghai Port Group announced on April 2 that according to internal data monitoring, the current operation of Shanghai Port is stable and orderly, and the berthing efficiency of Shanghai Port is significantly better than the overall level in 2021. Since March 28, the average waiting time of container ships in Shanghai Port has been less than 24 hours, and the average waiting time has been less than 10 ships. SIPG emphasized that the production and operation of the terminal are normal, and there is no congestion of container ships. Although terminal operations have not been affected, the reporter learned that under the epidemic prevention and control, the container transshipment system has been greatly affected, and inter-provincial transportation has been greatly affected. Liu Min, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce, said, “Shanghai is indeed facing some difficulties in ensuring the supply of living materials, such as the lack of smooth inter-provincial logistics due to the impact of the epidemic, and the lack of terminal capacity resulting in delayed delivery. We are working hard to get through with the support of all parties. Blocking points, solving difficulties, and trying to ensure the basic living needs of citizens during the epidemic.” (The epidemic prevention seal on the collection card taken on April 7. Photo by Xinhua Finance reporter Yang Youzong) On a Shanghai D license plate collection card in the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Shanghai, the reporter saw that a seal was pasted next to the driver’s cab, and the seal was signed as “Nantong Tongzhou District Traffic Port Prevention and Control Team”. A driver said that many places are now unable to get off the high-speed, and the pass does not work, and some places do not recognize it . “Some drivers will not let them go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and can only pull the goods back.” The driver, Zhang Chaohua, said that on April 1, he drove a pickup truck to a certain place in Jiangsu, where he queued from 7 am to 12 pm, but was told before getting off the expressway that the Shanghai license plate could not get off the expressway, so he had to go back the same way. . Strict policies are behind the continuous tightening of epidemic prevention and control policies. On April 5 and April 6, Ningbo, Zhejiang reported 8 cases of infections related to road freight, including truck drivers, long-distance freight drivers, and gas station staff in high-speed service areas. After tracing the source of the flow, the trajectories of the cases focus on high-speed exits and high-speed service areas, especially restaurants, shower rooms, toilets, gas stations and other places in the high-speed service areas. The cost pressure of logistics enterprises will increaseThe repeated outbreak of the epidemic will have a greater impact on the express logistics industry. Beginning in early March this year, affected by the epidemic in many parts of the country, some transit centers and outlets were closed, and express delivery in many places was interrupted in stages. Some e-commerce platforms also experienced delivery delays and suspensions. According to a research report released by Sinolink Securities on April 5, the epidemic is expected to have a greater impact on express delivery services, and the volume of express delivery business is expected to decline. Data from the State Post Bureau shows that the volume of express delivery business in March is expected to drop by 2.5% year-on-year, and the revenue of express delivery business is expected to drop by 4.4% year-on-year. The industry entered the off-season in March, and the price side remained stable. The impact of the epidemic may disrupt the growth pace of the express delivery business in the early stage. Prior to this, the performance of many express delivery companies has entered the cashing period. The main operating data released by YTO from January to February 2022 shows that its express delivery business completed 2.297 billion tickets, a year-on-year increase of 27.81%; the operating income was about 7.624 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 39.28%; the net profit attributable to the parent was about 545 million yuan. , a year-on-year increase of 186.36%. According to the annual report of SF Holding, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the profit was 2.471 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 43.01%, and the non-net profit after deduction was 1.501 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.07%. Guosen Securities analyst Jiang Ming said that it is estimated that in the past two to three weeks, the epidemic has caused the business volume of the express delivery industry to decrease by 10% to 20% compared with usual. At the same time, considering the impact of the reduced business volume on the allocation of fixed costs, it is expected that the short-term profits of express companies will be affected by The negative impact outweighs the business volume. However, the impact of the epidemic is one-off, and the short-term express demand is more suppressed rather than disappeared. Therefore, it believes that after the epidemic resumes, express demand is expected to rebound. “Considering that the profits of leading express delivery companies will be greatly restored this year, the current valuation is relatively cheap, and we continue to recommend leading express delivery companies.” The global logistics supply chain continues to be impactedThe poor transportation of containers has affected the production and circulation of some enterprises. A person in charge of a company in Pudong said that the current circulation system is not smooth, and even if the company produces products, it is not easy to ship out, so the downtime is simply extended. Wang Hai, editor-in-chief of the shipping industry network and an analyst in the shipping industry, said that although terminal operations have not been affected, the closure and control measures will have a certain impact on truck transportation and container turnover, which may lead to some container companies to take corresponding adjustment measures. (A pickup truck parked in the Waigaoqiao area of ​​Pudong New District, Shanghai on April 7. Photo by Xinhua Finance reporter Yang Youzong) Maersk, a container shipping company, stated on its official website that at present, Shanghai ports such as Yangshan Port and Waigaoqiao Port are still operating normally, but the warehouses in the closed area have been seriously affected, and the efficiency of Maersk’s freight services to and from Shanghai will also be further affected. Maersk said it will provide multimodal transport services by barge and rail as an alternative to transport between Shanghai and nearby cities. Wang Ling, an analyst at East Asia Qianhai Securities, said that the lack of shipping capacity in the container industry has pushed up freight rates. In 2021, under the influence of multiple factors such as repeated COVID-19 epidemics, increased transportation demand, and limited supply of transportation capacity, the global logistics supply chain will continue to be challenged and impacted by complex situations such as port congestion, container shortages, and inland transportation delays, and the supply and demand relationship of container transportation will continue to be tense. . The container and dry bulk cargo industry already has the advantage of scale under the tight transportation capacity, and the leading enterprises in the global route are expected to benefit. The epidemic has brought a new shock to the gradually recovering economy, and the impact may extend throughout the first half of the year, as demand recovery and expected improvement will take time. Sheng Songcheng, executive vice president of the CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance, wrote in an article that as the epidemic is repeated in China’s core cities , the spillover effect of the epidemic will be more obvious. We should pay close attention to weak links in the economy, stabilize employment, protect people’s livelihood, and promote consumption. Continue to rationally relax real estate regulation from the demand side. Take infrastructure investment as an important starting point for stabilizing growth. Fiscal policy should be more proactive. Monetary policy should now pay more attention to the use of quantitative tools. “In fixed asset investment, infrastructure investment is more controllable, which can promote economic stabilization and improve market expectations in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, infrastructure investment is still an important starting point for stable growth this year, and under the impact of the epidemic, Infrastructure investment will play a more important role.” Sheng Songcheng said.
