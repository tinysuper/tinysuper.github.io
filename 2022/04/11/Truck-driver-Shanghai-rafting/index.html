<p>Some truck drivers were trapped in Shanghai for delivering supplies, some were blocked on highways, and some were quarantined at home because they had just returned to a medium-high-risk place. They are only one link in the construction of the logistics economy - the huge logistics chain is undergoing an unprecedented major test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Master Wei was wearing blue slippers and walking in the middle of the road. There were no moving cars on the road, nor could he hear any traffic or whistles. Every time he took a step, he could hear the rubbing of slippers and pebbles on the ground. The crickets in the open space on the side are also very lively. If you listen carefully, you can even find a few frog calls from the sound of the crickets.</p>
<p>This is the 12th day that Master Wei stayed in Shanghai, and the first night he moved to the roadside of Jingdong Road, Minhang District, Shanghai.</p>
<p>On March 28, Master Wei and two other truck drivers drove three vehicles, carrying nearly 100 tons of potatoes, from Laiwu, Jinan, to Shanghai. The plan of the three of Master Wei is to arrive in Shanghai in the early morning of the 29th, and after pulling the goods to the designated vegetable wholesale market, they will unload the truck and return, and they will be able to go home after two or three days.</p>
<p>However, this plan came to an abrupt end after arriving in Shanghai in the early morning of the 29th.</p>
<p>“The 29th is still normal, the 30th is basically half blocked, and the 31st is basically closed.” Master Wei told “Chinese Entrepreneurs”.</p>
<p>In the past, Master Wei also often traveled to Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, but most of them were general goods such as construction site building materials and raw materials. This was the first time he shipped vegetables to Shanghai.</p>
<p>“This Shanghai epidemic, there are fewer people pulling food here, and the shipping fee is a little higher, so we came here.” Master Wei told us that the shipping fee is about 2,000 yuan higher than before. Usually, there is no free high-speed fee when going to Shanghai. One round trip can earn more than 3,000 yuan, and this time, it can earn more than 5,000 yuan.</p>

<p>On April 8, Hangzhou issued a “Notice on Temporary Closure of Passage Measures at Some Expressway Toll Stations in Hangzhou”. 24 hour closing measures. It is understood that Hangzhou has closed 13 expressway toll stations including the Yuanpu exit of the Ring Expressway, the Huanghu exit of the Hangzhou-Changzhou Expressway, and the Zhangjiafan (in front of the institute) exit of the Hangjinqu Expressway.</p>
<p>In addition to Hangzhou, Shanxi, Shaoxing, Huainan, Hefei, Kunshan, Suqian, Xuzhou, Taizhou, Qingdao, Xi’an, Jinzhou, Shenyang and many other places have successively issued similar announcements, that is, due to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, some local expressways will be temporarily closed. toll. In addition to the closure of some expressways, Zhongshan, Hangzhou and other places have also issued notices to strengthen the management of epidemic prevention and control of truck drivers.</p>

<h5 id="After-being-trapped-for-12-days-use-potatoes-to-count-the-days"><a href="#After-being-trapped-for-12-days-use-potatoes-to-count-the-days" class="headerlink" title="After being trapped for 12 days, use potatoes to count the days"></a>After being trapped for 12 days, use potatoes to count the days</h5><p>“This is our car, this is the stove we use to make the fire, and this is the broken wood picked up from other people’s construction sites.” Master Wei showed us his current living area one by one - an open-air kitchen on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The place where Master Wei builds a fire and eats. Source: Respondents</p>
<p>The stove was remodeled from a paint bucket, and a large square was cut at the bottom. In order to make the pot stand and keep it stable, the mouth of the bucket was shaped like a petal. After several days of use, the interior of this remodeled stove has been smoked black, and the white paint stains on the outside have turned yellow.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Master Wei is from Jining, Shandong Province. He speaks fast and expresses directly. When introducing this open-air kitchen, he kicked the item being introduced. I don’t know that this is an attempt to make us see more clearly and intuitively. , I still have grievances about this pot and this stove - during this period of time in Shanghai, I ate two meals a day, and most of the time I ate boiled potatoes in water.</p>
<p>After the three of them arrived in Shanghai with nearly 100 tons of potatoes, they did not expect the vegetable market to be closed. So, who to give these potatoes to, how to unload them, and where should they go during this time have become problems.</p>
<p>This batch of potatoes was bought by Boss Xia in Shandong, and Master Wei took the order. Master Wei has been driving a truck for more than ten years. In the past, he drove a 6-meter-8 trolley. Three years ago, he replaced it with the current 13-meter-long trailer. This truck is full of more than 30 tons of potatoes.</p>
<p>On March 29, after learning about the closure of the vegetable market, Master Wei and his party were arranged to be in a warehouse rented by Boss Xia. This warehouse is located in Minhang District, Shanghai, next to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport. It is an Audi warehouse. The restaurants, supermarkets, and shops here have all closed, and you can only rely on yourself to eat and drink.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 7, Master Wei and his party stopped at a warehouse in Minhang District, waiting for the last truck of potatoes to be unloaded. Source: Respondents</p>
<p>In the first two days of arriving in Shanghai, Master Wei and his party still had some stored food, but the three adult men had three meals a day, and they ate them in three or four days. On April 3, Boss Xia entrusted two handfuls of noodles, oil and salt to be delivered. At that time, they had already eaten up their own stored food, so they began to eat this batch of potatoes shipped from Shandong, which was boiled without oil. Eat, you can fry and eat when there is oil.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 7, on the 10th day of being trapped in Shanghai, Mr. Wei’s potatoes in his car were all sold out, and there were still a whole carload of potatoes in the car of his friends, some of which were about to sprout. On the night of the 11th day of being trapped, nearly 100 tons of potatoes were sold out in three trucks.</p>
<p>“It didn’t work in the first few days. There were only a few boxes of goods a day, and it didn’t even move for a few days. It was better when it arrived on the sixth or seventh day. It was more than 100 boxes for a pull.” Master Wei said.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the 12th day of being trapped, Boss Xia withdrew from the warehouse, and they drove to the road more than 20 kilometers away from the warehouse, waiting for the lockdown to be lifted. Boss Xia, who never showed up, left two boxes of potatoes for Master Wei and the others, about 100 pounds in total, and some noodles.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many noodles, so we’ll eat it sparingly.” Now the three eat twice a day, the first at around 10 am and the second at around 3 pm. Judging from the current food, Master Wei estimates that it is about It can last six or seven days.</p>
<p>There are more than three people trapped in this Audi warehouse at the same time as Master Wei. Master Wei introduced that Boss Xia is from Anhui, and Boss Xia’s fellow villagers also pulled two trucks of goods and entered Shanghai at this special point, but they started from Hefei. During the waiting period, the number of drivers stranded here changed from 3 to 5, but we didn’t communicate much, just chatting occasionally.</p>
<p>In fact, Master Wei and other truck drivers have tried various channels to apply for a pass. <font color=red>“A friend who can apply for a pass in the circle of friends is just joking, and no one can get a pass for Shanghai. “</font></p>
<p>“My wife is on the phone with me every day, and it’s useless to worry.” When asking questions about family members, Master Wei’s speech rate will slow down. There are 6 people in Master Wei’s family. He is the pillar of the family and the main source of income for the whole family.</p>
<p>“We don’t know when we can go back.” Master Wei told us when contacted again on the evening of the 9th.</p>
<p><font color=red>On the afternoon of April 8, we called Boss Xia to learn more about the situation. He told us that he has been taken to the makeshift hospital, and it is inconvenient to disclose other things. </font>Master Wei told us that after eating potatoes for two or three days, Boss Xia was quarantined - Master Wei had already started counting the days when he went home with potatoes.</p>
<p>A Fantastic Drift of an Auto Parts Sample<br>About ten kilometers away from Master Wei, Liu Ronghui (pseudonym), who is located in Shanghai Pudong New Area, is isolated at home. This is the 17th day of his detention, and it is unknown how many days he is working from home.</p>
<p>“As a dead fat house, I didn’t lose weight by exercising every day. This time, I kept it at home, giving non-staple food to the elderly and children, and giving snacks to my wife. I went out to volunteer from time to time to help, and I lost 8 pounds…”</p>
<p>Where can I buy in groups, and where can I grab food? How to stabilize my daughter when her homework is decreasing day by day? How to answer the customer’s urging, how to online, as much as possible to ensure the supply? For nearly a month, these three questions have plagued him alternately.</p>
<p><font color=red>“I have used all my papering skills in my life, but I am still riddled with holes.” </font> Liu Ronghui told us. (Note: The paper craftsman was originally a paper-paper worker. Li Hongzhang also mocked himself as a paper-paper craftsman. Later, this statement was gradually extended in East China. There were beautification and patchwork, but there was no way to solve the core problem. mean.)</p>
<p>After 1985, Liu Ronghui worked for a well-known parts manufacturer in Shanghai, with customers all over the world. “Basically all mainstream car companies use my parts.” Liu Ronghui said.</p>
<p>On March 14, Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province issued a notice to initiate a Level I emergency response. From now on, the city will completely suspend work, business, school, public places, and crowd gathering activities. At the same time, strict transportation control measures will be adopted throughout the city.</p>
<p>In this case, the companies involved in the region will stop production, and the inter-provincial logistics and express delivery will also stop. However, the new project samples in charge of Liu Ronghui need to be assembled and sent from the factory in Pinghu.</p>
<p>Pinghu City is a county-level city hosted by Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, next to Shanghai, where many world-renowned multinational companies, global industry leaders, chain-owner companies and benchmarking companies gather here. Automobiles, high-end machine tools and new materials are the advantages here. industry.</p>
<p>According to the “China Economic Times” report: Pinghu City leverages the strong chain extension of the automobile industry with “chain master” enterprises. There are 272 auto parts companies, including 8 of the top 100 global auto parts companies such as ABB in Switzerland, GKN in the United Kingdom, and Lear in the United States. They have formed a complete industrial chain supporting capability of “production of the whole car in Pinghu”, and are associated with auto parts every year. The production capacity is more than 5 million units. At present, Great Wall Motors has more than 50 supporting enterprises in Pinghu. <font color=red> It is reported that Pinghu has become one of the largest new energy drive motor production bases in the country. The total output value of the automobile industry chain is expected to exceed 50 billion yuan within two years, and will reach a scale of 100 billion yuan in five years.</font></p>
<p>“The car is not allowed to go directly to Shanghai.” Because the sealed samples cannot be sent directly to customers in other regions, and the trucks that customers collect goods cannot pick up the goods, Liu Ronghui’s “paper pasting” skills have been inspired.</p>
<p>“First, I found a way to find a customer with a temporary correspondence certificate, took the samples out of the urban area, and sent a special car to the customer after thinking of the transit warehouse in Jiaxing City. I didn’t expect the logistics company there to say that it would not accept the order to Shanghai. The reason is very It’s simple, the return trip from Shanghai will require 14-day quarantine.” <font color=red>Faced with this situation, Liu Ronghui could only arrange a special logistics vehicle to the brother factory in Changzhou, Jiangsu, and then let other customers’ logistics vehicles that have not left Pinghu take the samples away. Completely bypasses Shanghai.</font></p>
<p>On the evening of March 18, the samples finally arrived in Changzhou. But what made Liu Ronghui feel devastated was that a notice was issued on the same day, saying that 19 daily states would also have 3 days of closure and control management and nucleic acid of all staff.</p>
<p>“The mood at that time was like a refugee who escaped from Hiroshima to Nagasaki in 1945.” Liu Ronghui said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the samples finally arrived in the hands of the customer. After seeing the news of the closure and control, major OEMs rushed to Changzhou before 24:00 on the 18th, towed away all the finished product inventory that could be towed away by the supplier, and took samples along the way. .</p>
<p>“The industrial belt is going crazy. The Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are the main suppliers. The mainland of Changchun is an ecu supplier. Changchun has been closed for almost a month. It’s gone.” Liu Ronghui said.</p>
<p>Companies such as Tesla and Weilai have been affected.</p>
<p>On March 28, according to Reuters , Tesla plans to suspend the production activities of its super factory in Shanghai from March 28 for 4 days due to the impact of Shanghai’s epidemic prevention policy. Bloomberg also previously reported that Tesla’s Shanghai plant will stop production for at least one day starting on Monday (March 28).</p>
<p>On April 8, Guotai Junan Futures wrote in a research report: Affected by the epidemic, the production of 550,000 tons of polyester bottle flakes in East China has recently been reduced to around 70%. Affected by the epidemic and logistics, some major polyester industrial yarn factories have reduced their production load or even stopped production this week, such as Yufu, Jinhuite and Wenlong have stopped production, and the load of Sunway and Sunfull has increased slightly. July 7), the overall theoretical start-up load of domestic polyester industrial yarn dropped to about 63%. In addition, Hilead’s current operating load is temporarily maintained, but the Haining area is controlled by the epidemic and cannot enter or leave the logistics. If there are not enough raw and auxiliary materials for Hilead and the logistics has not resumed, production must be reduced and stopped.</p>
<p>On April 9, NIO issued a “Note on Recent Production and Delivery”. NIO said that since March, due to the epidemic, the company’s supply chain partners in Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu and other places have successively stopped production. It has not been restored yet. Affected by this, Weilai’s vehicle production has been suspended.</p>
<p>Weilai said that the delivery of many users’ vehicles will be delayed in the near future. “I also ask for your understanding. The company will work with supply chain partners to resume production as soon as possible and deliver vehicles to everyone as soon as possible on the premise of meeting the requirements of epidemic prevention.”</p>
<p>Drivers become in short supply “materials”<br>As long as it can be delivered, regardless of the cost and transportation needs that do not consider the timeliness, logistics companies are also “papering”.</p>
<p>On April 3, Gaopeng received a notice in the tenant communication group in the park. The notice reads: According to the spirit of the “Kunshan Epidemic Prevention and Control Announcement No. 24 in 2022”, each company will take a silent break from April 3 to April 6, and employees of the company will return to their place of residence to participate in regional nucleic acid testing.</p>
<p>Gao Peng is the head of Huayuan World Logistics. The company is located in German Industrial Park, Zhangpu Town, Kunshan. Many precision machinery companies have settled in this park, such as Eisenmann China Automobile Assembly Line Production Base, Berger Precision Machinery Parts (Kunshan) Co., Ltd.; Jiangsu Changjiang Water Pump Co., Ltd.; and many logistics companies, such as DHL (Sinotrans) DHL).</p>
<p>It is understood that Kunshan is a major production center for PCB, electronic foundry, panels, and notebook computer components. Nandian, Xinxing, AUO, Visionox, Longteng Optoelectronics, Shishuo, Compal, and Luxshare have factories in the area. . The main customers of Huayuan Tianxia Logistics are mostly electronic components, packaging consumables and mold products from nearby factories.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t stopped since the New Year.” After seeing the notice, Gao Peng complained inwardly. But Tucao returned to Tucao, and the movements in his hands did not stop. Before the silence time came, Gao Peng and the others packed up the things that should be packed, and some colleagues who had come from Suzhou went back to Suzhou. It is understood that Huayuan World Logistics has two offices, one in Suzhou and the other in Kunshan.</p>
<p>“Not long after the New Year, there was an epidemic in Suzhou. After Suzhou, Shanghai came out, and then there were sporadic epidemics in Hangzhou and Zhejiang, which have always been around us.” Gao Peng concluded with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Master Gao is one of the hired drivers of Huayuan World Logistics. Unlike Master Wei, he is not personally affiliated. He is currently isolated at home and can still get the basic salary from the company.</p>
<p>On March 9, Master Gao received a notice from the community and asked him to isolate at home because he went to Shanghai once at the end of February and has never been to Shanghai since. Now, this is the second time he has been quarantined because of the epidemic in Kunshan itself, and the quarantine period starts on April 1.</p>
<p>“Since the outbreak of the epidemic, I have been in quarantine almost all the time, and I haven’t run much in the past two months. A colleague ran for a few days last month and has been in isolation.” Master Gao also told us that the company’s Kunshan side There are also seven or eight drivers, all of whom are in home quarantine.</p>
<p>A suitable driver has become a shortage of “materials”.</p>
<p>“For example, when you go to Henan, as long as you enter Henan, the green code will turn yellow (code). Henan is right in the middle of China, and many people who travel from south to north have to pass through Henan.” Gao Peng told us that after the epidemic in Shanghai became serious, Corresponding strict control measures have been issued in many places. These measures have become a sieve, and there are not many drivers who can stay.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the smooth passage of living materials, the green pass issued by Henan Province. Source: Respondents</p>
<p>Gao Peng told “Chinese Entrepreneurs” that many older drivers have a junior high school degree, or even less than a junior high school degree. It is very difficult to get a driver’s license. How to smoothly switch and use the health codes of various cities when crossing provinces and cities is a “threshold”.</p>
<p>“For example, from Nanjing to Suzhou, Suzhou has the code of Suzhou, and Nanjing has the code of Nanjing. They may not be able to get it when they are old, but this must be done by themselves.” Gao Peng explained, “The isolation of isolation, the yellow code I can’t run, and it will take several days to change back for the next job, and those who don’t know how to use these health codes, the transport vehicles are seriously insufficient now.”</p>
<p>In late March, Master Gao, who had just been released from the first quarantine, went out to deliver goods.</p>
<p>“At that time, the local area in Kunshan required a blue label, a green label, and an orange label. I set up a blue label and planned to go from Kunshan to Suzhou on the high-speed.” The color label in Master Gao’s mouth is similar to the “truck version” of the health code.</p>
<p>It is understood that on March 25, Kunshan City implemented the “Classification Management System for Trucks by Risk Level”, and applied “orange, blue and green” classification management signs for trucks based on the health information of truck drivers and passengers, and based on the “orange, blue, green” classification management system “Three-color signs for precise prevention and control.</p>
<p>Blue indicates that there is a history of passing through low-risk areas outside Kunshan City, and the itinerary card does not have an asterisk.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Gao got his salary for March, a total of more than 5,000 yuan. What is different from the past is that the income structure has changed from basic salary plus commission to basic salary plus subsidy.</p>
<p>“To be honest, it’s not a lot, because it’s a total of four or five days of class.” Master Gao said.</p>
<p>It is understood that in the logistics industry, many drivers who run long-distance trunk lines are paid by trip. For example, if you specially run from Beijing to Guangzhou, it will take four or five days for a round trip, and the intermediate loading and unloading will stay for one day. You can run three or four times a month, and the commission is the main source of income.</p>
<p>Gao Peng reluctantly said: “It may be a month, two months of hard support, and only three months to pay the basic salary. Large companies may be fine, but small and micro enterprises like us basically can’t stand it all the time. “</p>

<p>On the evening of April 7, Kunshan issued the No. 37 Circular on Epidemic Prevention and Control, and decided to extend the silence period for 4 days from 24:00 on April 8 to 24:00 on April 12, 2022.</p>
<p>On April 8, AUO, a major panel manufacturer, issued an announcement stating that its Kunshan subsidiary will suspend work from April 8 to 12 in cooperation with the local government’s epidemic prevention and control policy. During the shutdown period, inventory will be allocated to reduce the impact on customers.</p>
<p>Guanghua-KY, a car interior parts factory, pointed out that its subsidiary Xiangyang Guangjia has flexibly adjusted its production plan due to the suspension of production due to the tightening of epidemic control and logistics blockades in Shanghai, Wuxi and Kunshan for its main customers. At present, sufficient raw material inventory has been prepared to meet the production needs of customers after resumption of work.</p>
<p>According to the Aijiwei APP, other Taiwanese factories that have announced the suspension of the Kunshan subsidiary include AUO, Xinxing, Baicheng, Lantian, Huafu, Anli-KY, Shanghua, etc.</p>
<p>Compared with the material problems that can be perceived immediately, the B-side supply chain hiding behind the daily consumption of the public cannot be perceived at the first time.</p>
<p>“Adding all kinds of time costs, the transportation cost will definitely be high. As far as I know, these companies will lose a part of the money if they send a truck of goods, and the freight will increase by nearly four or five times.” Gao Peng told us.</p>
<p>wait for a rebound<br>For companies, transportation costs increase and production capacity is limited; for drivers, income decreases.</p>
<p>“The congestion started around 12 o’clock, and there are still about 3 kilometers to reach the toll station. It is estimated that it will be blocked until 6:00 in the evening to get off the expressway.” On April 8, we got in touch with Master Deng. Among the drivers, and among the acquaintances and colleagues around the driver, the only one still running on the road.</p>
<p>Master Deng mainly runs short and medium distances, mainly in Jiangsu. There are two main routes for frequent runs, Changzhou to Suqian and Changzhou to Xuzhou. He used to be an accountant in a factory mainly engaged in frozen chicken and duck agricultural products. Five or six years ago, the owner of the factory proposed to let him buy a car and help him pick up the goods. Master Deng started his career as a driver.</p>
<p>At 6:00 in the morning of April 7th, Master Deng set out from Changzhou and arrived in Suqian at 4:00 in the afternoon. After loading the goods, he went back from Suqian. He slept in the service area at night. If it is not blocked, he should be home soon when we contact him. .</p>
<p>In the mouth of truck drivers, roads are divided into “on the road” and “off the road.” The upper road is the expressway, and the lower road includes various national roads, provincial roads, and rural roads. Spanning hundreds of thousands of kilometers, except for large-scale logistics, few drivers will take high-speed all the way. Under the epidemic, in order to reduce the time stuck on the road, most of the drivers chose the high speed.</p>
<p>“If you go down the road, there are checkpoints in every region and every county, and they are all checked. The congestion will be even worse, and you may not be able to get there for a few days. Only the exit of the expressway is blocked, and the others are unblocked.” Master Deng told us.</p>
<p>Master Deng calculated an account for us: before the epidemic, it was about 4,000 yuan per order, and now it has increased by almost a few hundred, but it cannot reach the previous profit. Although the driver can get an extra subsidy of 500 yuan, it may cost 1,000 yuan to go on the highway. After all, the driver still earns 500 yuan less, and there are always traffic jams. The original cost, including fuel fees and high-speed charges, was about 2,000 yuan per trip, but now it’s about 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>This means that the price of a single trip has increased, but the profit and one-month income have fallen.</p>
<p>“The outbreak of the epidemic in Shanghai was almost 10 times a month, but now it can only run about six or seven times. In the past month, the loss is nearly 10,000 yuan. It used to be about 20,000 yuan a month, but now I earn 10,000 yuan. Money is difficult.” Master Deng said.</p>
<p>In addition to fewer trips and profits for drivers, the company is also cutting production.</p>
<p>“Compared with the original, the company’s sales volume has decreased by about 30%. We are refrigerated, the shelf life is 12 months, and it is not affected by the weather very much. However, if it cannot be sold, the storage cost will increase, so we can only reduce production.” Master Deng, an accountant, keenly captured this change.</p>
<p>It’s not just Mr. Deng’s company that has increased costs.</p>
<p>“Recently, the Shanghai port is in a state of semi-paralysis. If the ship is not chartered, the freighter will jump to the port. If Shanghai is closed for two weeks, the freighter will first go to Fukuoka, Busan, and return after a month. The bulk parts are basically only safe stocks. Some small-volume materials can still be transshipped by the China-Europe Railway, and large-volume railway transportation costs are not worth the goods, so it is better to stop production.” Liu Ronghui told us that now OEMs are mainly eating inventory, and now physical goods and inventory are king. era.</p>
<p>Zheng Cuntuan of China-Europe Qatar Airways told us: China-Europe Qatar Airways has been operating normally, and its sources of goods are mainly from Fujian, Guangdong. And the company’s business has grown significantly. It’s hard to tell where the current growth is coming from, though, and it will take two months to know. Because many customers are in urgent need to go to China-Europe Qatar Airways, the planned cargo (after six months) will go slowly by sea.</p>
<p>As long as demand is there, the impact may be short-lived, and a rebound is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>“Maybe this period of time will have a serious impact on some small and micro enterprises, but in the long run, if you give some economic stimulus, you should be able to survive. In 2020, we will also send epidemic prevention materials to Wuhan. The first half of the year is very difficult. Difficulties, the manufacturing and logistics industries in the second half of the year are soaring. “ Gao Peng said.</p>
<p>“I believe that the vitality of the enterprise will not have much impact.” Zheng Cuntuan said.</p>
<p>The stabilization and recovery of the supply chain has already begun.</p>
<p>According to reports, on April 7, the Ministry of Transport held a meeting on the logistics guarantee coordination working mechanism. The National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Health and Health Commission and other members of the mechanism attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting emphasized that coordinating the work of epidemic prevention and control and logistics security is an important task to win the new round of epidemic prevention and control, and it is to ensure the safety and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain, and maintain the normal production and living order of the people. important foundation.</p>
<p>The meeting pointed out that the problems of inadequate implementation of policies in some regions and overweighting at various levels still exist, and the problem of poor logistics operation in some epidemic-related regions such as the Yangtze River Delta is more prominent. The operation is smooth and the service guarantee for truck drivers is strengthened.</p>
<p>On April 8, Xiao Yaqing, Minister of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that all efforts should be made to stabilize the production of enterprises and the smooth connection of the supply chain, strengthen the coordination of logistics, transportation and factor guarantees, open up blocking points, and ensure the smooth transportation of key materials and important products.</p>
<p>On the evening of April 9, Master Wei was still counting potatoes on the side of the road, waiting to go home. We wanted to help him find some supplies to send as much as possible, but Master Wei refused, “Don’t bother, it’s all sealed here, it’s hard to get it, so don’t cause trouble for everyone.”</p>
