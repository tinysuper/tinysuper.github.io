        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Daniel Moog</strong></p><p>The high-quality white pigment titanium dioxide has many applications. Coagulation or agglomeration of a TiO2 dispersion must be avoided at all costs, both in the manufacturing process and in the processing, e.g. by manufacturers of paints and coatings. This applies in particular to highly filled systems, such as pigment preparations and pigment pastes, where a high degree of particle stabilization is indispensable.</p><!-- more --><p>Purely electrostatic stabilization is not sufficient to stabilize highly concentrated pigment preparations and pigment pastes in such a way that they do not exhibit flocculation and segregation states during storage and processing.</p><p>For this reason, highly filled systems are stabilized either purely sterically or in a certain ratio of electrostatic and steric stabilization. Stabilization with electrostatic and steric components is referred to as electro-steric stabilization.</p><p>Illustration of the measurement setup<br><img src="https://analytik.news/en/grafik/papers/1131_1.jpg" alt="Fig.1: Illustration of the measurement setup"><br>Fig.1: Illustration of the measurement setup<br>(a) ESA probe, (b) measurement chamber,<br>(c) mechanical stirrer, (d) pipette,<br>(e) dispersion, (f) pH probe and<br>(g) conductivity probe. [Source:<br>“Electroacoustic Quantification of Surface<br>Bound Ligands in Functionalized Silica and<br>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles”, Whiley Publishers]<br>By adjusting the ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization, it may be possible to adjust the viscosity properties of the products. To maintain structural viscosity properties, as is often required in the field of paints and coatings, electrostatic stabilization is often necessary. For viscosities that should be independent of the shear rate (Newtonian viscosity behavior), purely steric stabilization may be useful.</p><p>The electroacoustic ESA measuring technique used is used to record the stabilization process during the addition of additives to an aqueous TiO2 pigment preparation (Figure 1). The measured data show the level and type of stabilization as a function of the added additive concentration. By using the ESA method, additive concentrations can be determined which lead to defined electro-steric or steric stabilization ratios. These dispersion states, which are now known, can then be transferred to the formulation development or formulation optimization of a pigment preparation.</p><p>In summary, the following advantages result from the use of the ESA measuring technique for recording a stabilization process through the addition of additives:</p><ul><li>Assignment of quantitative stability states to the added additive quantities.</li><li>Exact adjustment of electro-steric or pure steric stabilization states.</li><li>Avoidance of additive excess by detection of the complete surface coverage with the surface affine additive groups.</li><li>Estimation of the polymer layer thickness applied to the particles by the electrical double layer.</li><li>Control of dispersion products after storage or in production.</li><li>Evaluation of the ESA raw data signal enables measurement and evaluation without knowledge of the physical substance data. With knowledge of physical substance data, an exact derivation of the zeta potential from the ESA raw data signal is possible.</li></ul><h2 id="Materials-measurement-technology-and-devices"><a href="#Materials-measurement-technology-and-devices" class="headerlink" title="Materials, measurement technology and devices"></a>Materials, measurement technology and devices</h2><p>The materials used for the measurements and the measuring technique are listed below. The measurements were carried out by the company Pulveranalyse Dipl.-Ing. Daniel Moog, a contract laboratory specializing in dispersion analysis.

The wetting and coating of the TiO2 pigment surfaces with the additive polymer leads to a decrease in the zeta potential, which is also a measure of the thickness of the applied polymer layer. The ratio of electrostatic to steric stabilization can be detected and thus precisely adjusted.</p><p>zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment<br>Fig.2: Recording of the decrease of the zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment during additive addition. The measurement<br>was carried out under strong stirring, which prevents sedimentation and ensures homogeneous mixing.<br><img src="https://analytik.news/en/grafik/papers/1131_2.jpg" alt="Recording of the decrease of the zeta potential of TINOX R-2160 TiO2 pigment during additive addition"></p><p>zeta potential of TINOX R-2140 TiO2 pigment<br>Fig.3: Recording of the decrease of the zeta potential of TINOX R-2140 TiO2 pigment during additive addition.

The results show that the recommended additive concentrations of the additive manufacturers are good guidelines, but that the surface chemistry of the titanium dioxide pigments can vary so much due to post-treatment processes and manufacturing methods that for many TiO2-pigment grades a precise adjustment of the formulation is necessary. This is especially true when highly filled systems are manufactured at the maximum possible concentration, as is the case with pigment formulations and pigment pastes.<br>Conclusion<br>The ESA technique used in the present experiments has been elaborated in a particular way for different applications.</p><p>In the technical production process, dispersions are usually highly concentrated, turbid, colored or tempered. They are often electrostatically influenced by added additive formulations. Often the sedimentation of the mixture in the reactor must be prevented by powerful agitators. Stability analysis by means of electrokinetic sonic amplitude includes all parameters. Thus, the data of the samples analyzed in highly concentrated form can be directly transferred to the electrokinetic properties of the dispersed particles in the raw material or in the finished product.</p><p>By controlled recording of the stabilization process, it was possible to develop a stable semi-finished product with TINOX R-2140 as a pigment preparation with 78% TiO2 for aqueous dip coating applications, which showed no tendency to agglomeration even during subsequent strong dilution processes. The stabilization process could be deciphered a bit further and the dispersion states can be checked by means of ESA technology for process and quality control (see illustration Figure 4).</p><p>metrological recording of stabilization prozess<br>Fig.4: Illustration of the metrological recording of the stabilization process.<br><img src="https://analytik.news/en/grafik/papers/1131_4.jpg" alt="Illustration of the metrological recording of the stabilization process."></p><p>Information on the measurement method used<br>From a scientific point of view, the use of the ESA measurement technique is a method for direct quantification of accessible hydroxide groups on the surface of particles and a profound way for surface quantification of different ligands. While electrophoretic methods for zeta potential surface characterization for technical applications are limited by too high dilutions, sedimentation processes, irregular particle shape or inaccessible physical substance data, the ESA method is a complementary measurement technique for analysis in technical applications.</p><p>The ESA method for characterizing the charge stability of particles in a dispersion is an electroacoustic measurement technique.</p><p>An oscillating voltage is applied to a suspension, dispersion or emulsion, which is generated by an alternating current source. Charged particles in the dispersion oscillate at the frequency of the externally applied electric field. One or more frequencies can be applied. The oscillation of the particles at these frequencies generates sonic waves. The amplitudes of these sonic waves are measured as electrokinetic sonic amplitude (ESA). This ESA signal is proportional to the dynamic mobility of the particles and this in turn is proportional to the zeta potential of the particles present in the dispersion. A prerequisite for the use of this effect is a certain density difference between dispersion medium and particle. To generate evaluable signals, this density difference must be at least 0.2 g/cm3.</p>]]></content>

The ilmenite is processed through an oxidizing roast followed by magnetic separation and is then partially reduced to an 85 per cent TiO2 slag in one of four six-in-line a.c. electric arc furnaces. The slag is milled and then classified into two<br>product sizes suitable as a raw material for both the sulphate and chloride pigment processes. The high quality iron produced during the reduction process is further processed to produce various grades of low-manganese iron.<br>Around 95 per cent of the products are exported, yielding a world market share of about 25 per cent of titania slag, rutile, high quality pig iron, and zircon.<br>See more details at <a href="https://www.saimm.co.za/Conferences/Pyro2006/181_RBM.pdf">Heavy Mineral Processing at Richards Bay Minerals</a>.</p><h2 id="The-price-of-tio2-will-surge-again"><a href="#The-price-of-tio2-will-surge-again" class="headerlink" title="The price of tio2 will surge again?"></a>The price of tio2 will surge again?</h2><p>Even now, the RBM throwed a huge stone into the calm lake.

After the stock cleaning, the distributors are not yet planing to make new stocks. And to the tio2 manufactures, after the fulfilling of first half orders, now only few obtained orders at hand. Some tio2 manufactures even got into panic and start to lower the price for orders. But their cost is not low, so they choose to make special offers to certain buyers. Some analysists refers that it is a centralized-cleaning of inferior products produced in the previous production.</p><h3 id="Secondly-RBM’s-issue-needs-time-to-pass-the-wave"><a href="#Secondly-RBM’s-issue-needs-time-to-pass-the-wave" class="headerlink" title="Secondly, RBM’s issue needs time to pass the wave."></a>Secondly, RBM’s issue needs time to pass the wave.</h3><p>Most of RBM raw is in high grade supplied to chloride production. And firstly, the impact will on the international CP grade producers. According to reliable source, the Kronos’ long term supply contract is one of the first contracts to be suspended.</p><h3 id="Last-by-not-least-the-trend-may-shows-two-level-differentiation-in-shorterm"><a href="#Last-by-not-least-the-trend-may-shows-two-level-differentiation-in-shorterm" class="headerlink" title="Last by not least, the trend may shows two-level differentiation in shorterm."></a>Last by not least, the trend may shows two-level differentiation in shorterm.</h3><p>To the SP suppliers from China, the shortage of oredrs is still the fact to small and medium tio2 manufacturers. Those who can not take the pressure may turned to adjust their price strategy.<br>But under the impact of RBM, the CP grade tio2 manufactures has no doubt will increase their price to cease the impacts in fourth quarter. And gradually, this impact will be passed to SP tio2 manufactures also.</p><h2 id="Any-forecasts-or-suggests"><a href="#Any-forecasts-or-suggests" class="headerlink" title="Any forecasts or suggests?"></a>Any forecasts or suggests?</h2><p>To our estimation, the general price of SP grades may slightly drop in shorterm, but not much, and the second half of 2021, it is still on a solid strong ground.<br>To CP grades, the big players may announce a new round of price increase in the middle of August 2021.<br>Suggestion?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a number of titanium dioxide manufacturers said that the global demand for titanium dioxide is strong and the supply is tight, and the market price may continue to rise. Major producers Chemours, Venator, Tronox and Kronos reported positive results in the first quarter and expect their performance to continue to grow for the rest of this year.</p><!-- more --><h3 id="Increase-in-sales-and-decrease-in-inventory"><a href="#Increase-in-sales-and-decrease-in-inventory" class="headerlink" title="Increase in sales and decrease in inventory"></a>Increase in sales and decrease in inventory</h3><p>“Chemours’ sales in the first quarter increased by 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The demand for coatings, plastics and laminates in Chemours’ titanium technology business continued to increase in the second quarter.” Chemours President and CEO Mark P. Vergnano stated on the May 4 earnings conference call, “In the first half of this year, new houses and renovations in various countries are driving the rapid growth of demand for architectural coatings. Since 2020, the demand for DIY products has maintained a strong momentum.”<br>John D. Romano from Tronox said that the sales volume of titanium dioxide in the first quarter increased by 15% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Demand in various regions was strong, but the largest growth was in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Simon Turner, chief executive officer of Venator, also said that market demand has unexpectedly grown strongly. All industries and regions have strong demand for functional titanium dioxide. The demand for specialty titanium dioxide products has shown a good momentum of recovery, mainly in the textile and automotive industries. Venator’s titanium dioxide sales volume has continuously increased by 14%. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, the device utilization rate has increased, and the inventory remains tight throughout the first quarter.</p><h3 id="Demand-is-back-on-track"><a href="#Demand-is-back-on-track" class="headerlink" title="Demand is back on track"></a>Demand is back on track</h3><p>The overall demand for titanium dioxide has basically returned to the level before the epidemic. The Kronos report shows that sales in the first quarter of this year were 141,000 tons, an increase of 4% from 136,000 tons in the same period last year, and an increase of 14% from 124,000 tons in the second quarter of 2020. The total sales volume in the third quarter of last year was 136,000 tons and the fourth quarter was 135,000 tons. Other manufacturers did not report sales, but their year-on-year sales growth data showed the same trend. Chemours’ titanium dioxide sales in the first quarter of this year increased by 16% year-on-year, while the first quarter of 2020 increased by 19% year-on-year, and the second quarter of 2020 decreased by 9% year-on-year. Tronox’s sales in the first quarter of this year increased by 16% year-on-year, the first quarter of last year sales increased by 6% year-on-year, and the second quarter fell by 27% year-on-year. Venators’ sales volume of Titanium Dioxide in the first quarter of this year was down 1% year-on-year, and in the second quarter of 2020, it was down 21% year-on-year.<br>Chemours Chief Operating Officer Mark Newman said: “The recovery in demand for titanium dioxide started when DIY products were launched in the second quarter of last year. Architectural coatings accounted for most of the company’s titanium dioxide business, and the rest was laminate and plastics business. Then there is the construction industry demand, especially the demand for new housing, which is growing rapidly. Based on the current development trend, sales are expected to increase in the next three quarters.”</p><h3 id="Supply-tends-to-be-tight"><a href="#Supply-tends-to-be-tight" class="headerlink" title="Supply tends to be tight"></a>Supply tends to be tight</h3><p>After the collapse of demand in the second quarter of last year, titanium dioxide producers around the world have drastically reduced their production, and then the slow recovery of production has resulted in a tight supply situation. Newman said: “Judging from the operation of our factory in March and April, our production in the second quarter will be higher than that in the first quarter. In addition, in terms of the supply of each factory, the supply of raw materials is restricted, but these are all It’s only a temporary impact.”  Venator also expressed a similar view.<br>Although the price of titanium dioxide is rising in the first quarter of this year, it has not fully recovered. At the same time, production costs are also increasing. Hassan Ahmed, an analyst at Alembic Global Advisors, an American investment research company, predicts that the price of titanium dioxide will continue to push up this year. He pointed out in a recent research report: “The current titanium dioxide price is only slightly higher than the 16-year average level and the 2008-2009 crisis period, so the upward potential is greater.” The price of ilmentile continues to rise, which may further push the price of titanium dioxide increasing.<br>Turner pointed out that China’s exports remained stable in the first quarter of this year, and the main export markets were other Asian countries and emerging markets. He said: “Due to the strong local demand for titanium dioxide in China, coupled with transportation restrictions, China’s exports to Europe and North America will fall, which will make customers more hope that we can provide reliable supplies.” Due to rising raw material and transportation costs, Chinese titanium dioxide producers are also continuously increasing their sales prices, thereby continuing to narrow the arbitrage space.<br>According to relevant data, Chemours, Venator, Tronox and Kronox together account for 40% of the global titanium dioxide production capacity, with a total global production capacity of 8.4 million tons/year in 2020. Chemours has the largest production capacity, about 1.2 million tons/year; followed by Tronox with 1 million tons/year;  Venator and Kronox both have 500,000 tons/year. In the past 10 years, China’s titanium dioxide production capacity has surged, from 2.1 million tons/year in 2011 to 3.7 million tons/year in 2020, accounting for 44% of the world’s total production capacity. During the same period, China’s annual net exports increased from 41,000 tons to 69,000 tons.</p>]]></content>

      <title>International rutile prices rose in the third quarter</title>
      <link href="2021/06/11/International-rutile-prices-rose-in-the-third-quarter/"/>
      <url>2021/06/11/International-rutile-prices-rose-in-the-third-quarter/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the recovery in Europe and America, the demand for titanium raw materials by European and American companies is also recovering. It is understood that driven by the growth of demand in Europe and the United States, ILUKA’s rutile quotation in the third quarter rose from the previous US$1,495/ton to US$1,640/ton. In addition to ILUKA, some foreign companies have also raised the price of 95 rutile. At present, the international quotations of 95 rutiles are all above US$1,600/ton, and the supply exceeds demand. According to several rutile manufacturers, the current western downstream users are more active in purchasing rutile raw materials, and the spot supply of rutile is tight.</p><p>In May, ILUKA announced that it would suspend the production of rutile mines in Sierra Leone after November this year, which will cause the global supply of rutile to drop by more than 140,000 tons per year. At the same time, the safety accident at Rio Tinto’s South Africa plant has made the plant’s future stability of high-titanium slag supply uncertain. If the output of ILUKA rutile is reduced while Rio Tinto’s South Africa titanium slag plant also sees a decline in output, then the global supply of high-grade titanium-rich materials at the end of this year will not be optimistic.</p><p>Judging from the current situation, the market prices of high-titanium slag and rutile have been determined to rise slightly in the third quarter. If the supply situation of Rio Tinto’s South Africa plant does fluctuate at the end of this year, the global price of rutile and titanium slag may rise sharply again in the fourth quarter. Some industry insiders believe that the price of 95 rutile may exceed US$1,800/ton by then. According to relevant analysis, customers in the welding consumables industry may be the most affected in the short term. Because other industries such as the chloride process titanium dioxide plant can choose the raw materials of high-titanium slag, artificial rutile, and natural rutile, while the welding material industry relies heavily on natural rutile and is more difficult to replace with other products.</p>]]></content>

      <title>The high-titanium slag market enters a short period of stability</title>
      <link href="2021/06/09/The-high-titanium-slag-market-enters-a-short-period-of-stability/"/>
      <url>2021/06/09/The-high-titanium-slag-market-enters-a-short-period-of-stability/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This month, the northern 90 titanium slag bidding price was 7,600 yuan/ton, an increase of 100 yuan/ton from last month. Since March, the price of 90 titanium slag has risen at a relatively large pace, mostly around 400 yuan/ton. The slowdown in the price increase this time indicates that the high-titanium slag market will enter a period of relatively stable prices in the future.</p><p>The reason why the price of high-titanium slag rose sharply in March and April was mainly due to the rapid increase in the price of ilmenite leading to rising costs. Recently, the northern high-titanium slag enterprises have gradually completed the establishment of ilmenite inventory, and the average ilmenite inventory is about 2-3 months. Therefore, the production cost of high-titanium slag in the north will be relatively stable in the future, and a single increase of 400 yuan/ton will temporarily bid farewell to the market. From a long-term trend, with the gradual resumption of production of western titanium dioxide companies, the demand for ilmenite in the West will also gradually increase, and the corresponding supply to the Chinese market will decrease. The recent discovery of a mutated new coronavirus in Vietnam has brought certain uncertainty to the future market trend. The Vietnamese market is my country’s main source of titanium slag raw materials. Although the supply has declined in recent years, it has maintained a relatively stable supply. In contrast, although ilmenite from Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Falkland Islands, and Norway appeared on the market some time ago, they cannot become a stable source. If the spread of the new coronavirus in Vietnam affects its export of ilmenite to my country, it may push up the price of domestic titanium chloride ore in the future. After the current inventory of ilmenite in the titanium slag plant is exhausted, the price of titanium slag may change again due to the cost of ilmenite.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Keyword-Flat"><a href="#Keyword-Flat" class="headerlink" title="Keyword: Flat"></a>Keyword: Flat</h2><p>Still the market is quiet this week, nobody is making noise at this point of time.</p><p>The demands is still at a low level, but the turning point of the crazy trend still not show up.</p><h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><ol><li><em>The expectation of the price increase in July is strong.</em> In april and last month, Kronos, Venator and Tronox announced their plan to increase the price in July. So will you chooice to decease the price for orders in June, if you are the manfuacture? I beg you will not.<br>If you will, you may choice to do it in May or early June, and increase it back in the late of June or the early July. Apparently, nobody was doing so.</li><li><em>The output is in a temporarily ups and down after a full load running of 6 months</em> Today, <a href="https://pangang-titanium.com/">Pangang group</a>s’ facility in Panzhihua area discontinued production due to accident. Meanwhile, in Guangxi and Guangdong province, the power is limited supply, and meets only half the needs of normal. Surprisingly, the Anatase supply is getting more tight than expected. As we all know, in the past, more and more users are shitfing to the Rutile grades due to its outstanding performance comparing with Anatase. But now, we found that, many users are shifting back to Anatase due the crazy price increase of Rutile, to whom a little compromise in quality is not a serious issue.  But more importantly, most of the producers of Anatase already shift their production line to Rutile and not willing to shit it back yet.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>stcn.com, Zhaoliyun</strong> Original content <a href="https://stock.stcn.com/djjd/202105/t20210512_3216342.html">年内第五轮涨价落地 钛白粉连涨11个月</a></p><p>As a product whose price fluctuations have attracted much attention from the market before, the announcement of titanium dioxide’s recent rise has been submerged in the “rising sound” of various commodities one after another. Inadvertently, titanium dioxide has been rising for 11 consecutive months, and the fifth round of price increases this year has also landed one after another, and the record for the longest product price increase is about to be broken.</p><h2 id="The-price-hike-lasted-for-nearly-a-year"><a href="#The-price-hike-lasted-for-nearly-a-year" class="headerlink" title="The price hike lasted for nearly a year"></a>The price hike lasted for nearly a year</h2><p>On May 10, the leader of the titanium dioxide industry, Lomon Baili(Known as LomonBillions), issued an announcement stating that, according to the current domestic and international titanium dioxide market conditions, the company will start from now on all types of titanium dioxide (including sulfuric acid titanium dioxide, chloride titanium dioxide) On the basis of the original price, the sales price will be raised by RMB 1,000/ton for various domestic customers and USD 150/ton for international customers.</p><p>Prior to this, another leading company in the industry, CNNC HUA YUAN Titanium Dioxide Co., Ltd(Known as CHTI), also issued a price adjustment announcement, stating that the overall increase in the sales price of the company’s main products will help further enhance the company’s continued profitability and improve the company’s market position and influence. It is expected to have an impact on the company’s operations. The results will have a positive impact.</p><p>The price adjustments of Lomon Baili and CNNC HUA YUAN Titanium Dioxide Co., Ltd are not alone. After the May 1st holiday, the titanium dioxide price market has remained strong and stable.</p><p>“At present, more than ten manufacturers including Anada, Hengtong Titanium, Longteng Titanium, Jiangsu Zhentai, Shandong Dongjia, Jinpu Titanium, Shandong Dawn, etc. have sent letters announcing an increase of 1,000 yuan/ton, in addition to Southwest etc. Several producers in the region went straight up by 800-1000 yuan/ton without letter, continuing the bullish market sentiment. The price market is already the fifth round of price increases this year.” Yan Ti analyst Yang Xun said.</p><p>Yang Xun introduced that the mainstream prices of most domestic sulfuric acid rutile and anatase titanium dioxides currently range from 19,800 to 21,000 yuan/ton and 18,300 to 19,000 yuan/ton. Domestic and imported chlorinated rutile titanium dioxides differentiate the mainstream prices by use At 21500-23500 yuan / ton and 27000-28500 yuan / ton (the above are all tax-included cash outbound prices). Since July 2020, the titanium dioxide market has been rising for 11 consecutive months, almost equal to the longest continuous rise record of titanium dioxide in 2016. The price market continues to be strong, and the price of holders is relatively hard. For low-price inquiries More resistant, more inclined to cash orders.</p><p>Zhuochuang analyst Tian Xiaoyu also said that the current domestic titanium dioxide market has been rising for 11 months, and the market price will also break through the historical high since 2012. During the period, as the most upstream of the titanium dioxide industry chain, titanium concentrate performed more prominently. In the second half of 2020 alone, the growth rate exceeded 65%, and in some stages it provided strong cost support for the price of titanium dioxide.</p><h2 id="Cost-support-high-price-continuation"><a href="#Cost-support-high-price-continuation" class="headerlink" title="Cost support high price continuation"></a>Cost support high price continuation</h2><p>What are the factors supporting the continued increase in the price of titanium dioxide? Is the price increase sustainable?</p><p>Yang Xun said that the current trading market is still very confrontational, and the price market is in a state of gaming. In terms of demand, industries such as plastic color masterbatches have entered the off-season, and overall demand has declined. At the same time, the downward transmission of costs is difficult, and it is more resistant to high-priced titanium dioxide, and production is simply stopped. In addition, high-priced titanium dioxide forces end customers to try alternatives. However, on the supply side, titanium concentrates are always tight and expensive, and the raw material cost of titanium dioxide remains high.</p><p>At present, the market has a large number of foreign trade orders, and the main manufacturers have received orders until June. The vast majority of manufacturers and distributors are tight in stock, especially some of the main brand products. What needs attention is that environmental inspections and emergencies have also caused some regional producers to suspend production, causing production capacity to shrink.</p><h2 id="Cost-support-is-indeed-one-of-the-main-reasons-why-the-price-of-titanium-dioxide-continues-to-rise"><a href="#Cost-support-is-indeed-one-of-the-main-reasons-why-the-price-of-titanium-dioxide-continues-to-rise" class="headerlink" title="Cost support is indeed one of the main reasons why the price of titanium dioxide continues to rise."></a>Cost support is indeed one of the main reasons why the price of titanium dioxide continues to rise.</h2><p>“Titanium concentrate is the main and important raw material in the production of titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide accounts for nearly 96% of the downstream consumption of titanium concentrate. Others are mostly used in the manufacture of sponge titanium. Since the bottom of the price in 2020, the price of titanium concentrate has doubled. The current national market average price is 2450 yuan/ton. At the end of April, major Panxi major manufacturers raised their sales guidance prices for May by 80-100 yuan/ton. Supported by the price of titanium concentrates on the main cost surface, the domestic titanium dioxide market after Labor Day A new round of growth has begun.” Tian Xiaoyu said.</p><p>Regarding the market outlook, Yang Xun believes that in the short term, the game between supply and demand is obvious, demand enters the off-season, and the terminal is more resistant to high-level titanium dioxide; supply-side manufacturers have high costs, smooth exports, tight spot prices, and low start-ups. Without the support of demand, the mid- to long-term market trend is still unclear, but the profit in May is as expected, and the current real order price is strong and firm.</p>]]></content>

(002145.SZ) issued a letter for the fifth increase in the price of titanium dioxide in the year.</p><p>In fact, entering May, listed companies such as Jinpu Titanium (000545.SZ) and Anada (002136.SZ) have also begun to raise the sales price of titanium dioxide, and the price increase in this round remains the same. Recently, the share prices of listed titanium dioxide companies have shown an upward trend. Benefiting from the continued rise in the price of titanium dioxide, the first quarter performance of the leading listed companies in the industry hit a new high during the same period.</p><p>An executive of Lomon Baili said in an interview with a reporter from “China Business News” that generally price increases are determined by cost and demand. This year’s consecutive price increases are mainly due to rising raw material costs and strong market demand; especially foreign market demand Further strengthening has made the first quarter performance of domestic titanium dioxide listed companies soar.</p><p><strong>Start a new wave of price increases?</strong></p><p>In the midday of May 6, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. issued an announcement stating that the company’s price committee decided that from now on, on the basis of the current sales price of titanium dioxide, the company’s sales prices for various types of titanium dioxide will be raised. Among them, the sales price for domestic customers is raised by RMB 1,000/ton, and the export price for international customers is raised by USD150/ton.</p><p>The reporter noticed that since the beginning of this year, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. has issued monthly announcements on raising the sales price of titanium dioxide. Looking at the leopard, as the industry’s leading company, the continuous price increase of CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. also represents the titanium dioxide industry.</p><p>In fact, in addition to CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd., the two listed companies of Jinpu Titanium Industry and Anada also raised the sales price of titanium dioxide, and the price increase of the three companies remained the same, which also indicates that titanium dioxide is expected to start a new round of price increases. tide.</p><p>Regarding the reasons for the price increase, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. said that it decided to increase the price “according to the recent market conditions of titanium dioxide and the increase in raw material prices.” Ananda also stated that the company decided to increase prices based on recent domestic and international market demand for titanium dioxide and rising prices of raw materials.</p><p>Earlier, Fu Yijiang, deputy secretary-general of the Titanium Dioxide Branch of the China Coatings Industry Association, said in an interview that after the global new crown pneumonia epidemic, the market is optimistic and demand is the main reason for the strong titanium dioxide market. The coatings, automotive paint and other markets have improved recently. Driven the increase in market demand for titanium dioxide, exports will continue to increase.</p><p>According to Fu Yijiang’s analysis, the upstream raw material of titanium dioxide is titanium concentrate, and its downstream applications are extensive, including coatings, automotive paint, medicine, food and other industries. The price of upstream titanium concentrate rose by 53% from June 2020 to February 2021. Downstream coatings, automotive paints and other fields are the application areas of titanium dioxide. In 2020, the national commercial housing sales area was 1.761 billion square meters, an increase of 2.6% year-on-year; the recent price increase in the coating industry has been soaring, and the price of titanium concentrate has continued to rise.</p><p>According to statistics from Zhuo Chuang Information, as of the end of April, the price of 46% titanium concentrate has been raised by RMB 150/ton from the previous month, with an average price of RMB 2,450/ton; on April 29, Panxi’s mainstream mining companies will guide their new orders for titanium concentrate prices in May. Raise 80 yuan/ton; as of the end of April, the market price of sulfuric acid in Shandong increased by 140 yuan/ton to 570 yuan/ton, and the price in the East China market rose by 60 yuan/ton to 565 yuan/ton. At the beginning of last July, the titanium concentrate was only 1175 yuan per ton.</p><p>The price of ilmenite concentrate has risen, and the price of sulfuric acid in the upstream is superimposed. These two major cost pressures have brought greater impetus to the price of the upstream market of titanium dioxide.</p><p>The Titanium Concentrate Analyst of Business Club believes that the actual price of titanium concentrate in Panxi is relatively strong, and the spot of titanium concentrate continues to be tight, and some miners are reluctant to sell it. The new price of titanium concentrate may rise steadily, and it is actually single. Discussion.</p><p>According to data from Baichuan, on April 23, the mainstream price of sulfuric acid rutile titanium dioxide market was 20000 to 21000 yuan/ton, the mainstream price of anatase titanium dioxide market was 17300~18000 yuan/ton, and the mainstream price of chloride titanium dioxide market was It is 22000 to 24000 yuan/ton.</p><p>Fu Yijiang told reporters that with the gradual improvement of the global epidemic, the climax of global resumption of production and work, coupled with the implementation of a new round of stimulus of 1.9 trillion USD by the Biden administration, has hindered the US industrial chain caused by the epidemic. In the context of a rapid rebound in U.S. demand driven by scale stimulus, U.S. imports from China have surged. From January to February this year, Chinese exports soared by 60.6% in U.S. dollars, of which exports to the United States increased by 87.3%. In December 2020, the United States passed a 900 billion USD stimulus package to promote a 10.8% year-on-year growth in US retail sales in January 2021, the highest increase in history since March 1994. It is expected that the 1.9 trillion USD stimulus will further drive the high increase in US imports from China, especially the demand for consumer goods and real estate-related commodities.</p><p>At the same time, he said that the U.S., Europe and the “Belt and Road” markets are gradually recovering, and the domestic and international dual cycles are oriented towards mutual promotion, which has become the new strategic direction of the Chinese economy after the epidemic. The demand for domestic and foreign consumer goods and real estate-related commodities will greatly stimulate China’s production output is increasing, and titanium dioxide is a rigid demand product in many fields. From the current global market, titanium dioxide will still be in a situation of “supply exceeds demand” in the short term.</p><p>According to the analysis of Zhuo Chuang Information, after the holiday, as expected, the logic of the market price increase in May will be clearer, including direct support from the cost-side raw material price increase and continued tight spot supply support. At present, downstream users on the demand side have also begun. In the face of continuous consumption of inventory, regular purchase plans need to be put on the agenda at the same time. Under high prices, the market outlook may show rigidity, so that in the process of price increases, the game advantages of buyers and sellers will still be biased towards the sellers, and ultimately promote the upward market price. .</p><p>CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. also stated that the company will closely follow the price trend of titanium dioxide and changes in supply and demand, and do a good job in adjusting the price of titanium dioxide products in a timely manner. The overall increase in the sales price of the company’s main products will help further enhance the company’s continued profitability, and will help improve the company’s market position and influence. It is expected to have a positive impact on the company’s operating results.</p><p><strong>Corporate performance rises</strong></p><p>Benefiting from the improvement of the industry’s prosperity, leading titanium dioxide companies performed well in the first quarter.</p><p>The reporter sorted out the financial report and noticed that recently, the first quarter of 2021 financial reports released by leading companies such as Jinpu Titanium Industry, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd., Anada, Lubei Chemical and other listed companies in the titanium dioxide industry showed that their performance has achieved substantial growth.</p><p>The financial report shows that on May 6, Jinpu Titanium released its first quarter report of 2021. During the reporting period, the company achieved operating income of 574 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.98%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 35 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1308.05 %. On April 30, Lubei Chemical (600727.SH) released the report for the first quarter of 2021. The company achieved total operating income of 928 million yuan, an increase of 38.73% year-on-year; net profit attributable to the parent company was 107 million yuan, an increase of 136.8% year-on-year.</p><p>In addition, on April 26, CNNC Hua Yuan Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. released its report for the first quarter of 2021. The company’s revenue was 1.236 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 49.53%; net profit was about 287 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 77.29%. Huiyun Titanium Industry (300891.SZ) released its first quarterly report for 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, the company achieved operating income of 319 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 51.99%. The net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 45 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 81.25%. . On April 24, Anadar issued a report for the first quarter of 2021. During the reporting period, the company achieved operating income of 406 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 58.50%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 31 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 28.54%.</p><p>Regarding the substantial increase in performance, Jinpu Titanium Industry stated that during the reporting period, the increase in operating income and profit was mainly due to the increase in sales volume, sales price and increase in the sales price of titanium dioxide, the main product during the reporting period, and the increase in gross profit.</p><p>Economist Song Qinghui analyzed to reporters that the sharp rise in profits of listed companies is also a manifestation of the industry’s further elimination of backward production capacity in the market in recent years, the continuous increase of industry concentration, and the manifestation of intensive benefits.</p><p>It can be seen that in recent years, leading titanium dioxide companies have expanded their layout and occupied market share.</p><p>At the end of February 2020, China Nuclear Power Titanium Dioxide released a 1.6 billion yuan fixed increase plan, and plans to raise funds for the 200,000 tons/year titanium dioxide post-processing project. Subsequently, on April 23, Lomon Baili issued an announcement stating that the number of non-public offerings would not exceed 368 million shares, and the total amount of raised funds would not exceed 4.387 billion yuan for use in titanium chloride slag and chlorinated titanium dioxide. Production and construction and supplementary working capital.</p><p>At the same time, in 2020, after Lubei Chemical acquired Jinhai Titanium Industry and Xianghai Titanium Industry, the titanium dioxide business became the company’s largest business. Lubei Chemical currently has an annual production capacity of over 100,000 tons of sulfuric acid titanium dioxide, and is proceeding in an orderly manner with the construction of a production line of 100,000 tons of sulfuric acid titanium dioxide and a production line of 60,000 tons of chloride titanium dioxide. After the project is completed, its titanium dioxide production capacity will reach 26 Million tons.</p><p>Qin Chong, a researcher at China Research and Puhua, told reporters that in 2019, the top 5 companies in the world’s titanium dioxide production capacity accounted for 90% of the industry’s production capacity, while the top ten concentration of my country’s titanium dioxide industry was about 68%, referring to the global situation It can be seen that there will still be acquisitions in the titanium dioxide industry in my country in the future to cater to the development trend of the industry. At the same time, with the help of listed companies, funding channels have been increased, and risk resistance has been increased for the development of enterprises. In addition, due to the implementation of environmental protection policies, the policy-oriented chlorination process will become the mainstream, and the new production capacity will basically be chlorination, which is also a manifestation of the company’s catering to the market.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Source: China Business News</p><p>　　Original title: Asia’s largest titanium dioxide company is trapped in an environmental vortex: Lomon Billion (31.600, -0.05, -0.16%) has been accused of “sewage” for many years<a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/relnews/cn/2020-12-19/doc-iiznezxs7758225.shtml" title="亚洲最大钛白粉企业陷环保旋涡：龙蟒佰利被指多年“排污”">https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/relnews/cn/2020-12-19/doc-iiznezxs7758225.shtml</a></p><p>　　 Our reporter Chen Jiayun and Jiaozuo report</p><p>“Located on the east side of the village, Lomon Billion (002601.SZ) has been burying industrial solid waste in the gully near many surrounding villages for so many years. It is also suspected of discharging sewage to the nearby Dasha River and piling up solid waste on the riverbed. Serious damage to the local ecological environment, affecting the normal life of the villagers.” On December 9, a villager in Hekou Village, Longxiang Sub-district Office, Zhongzhan District, Jiaozuo City, Henan Province said angrily to a reporter from China Business News.</p><p>　　Located in the western industrial agglomeration area of Jiaozuo, Henan, Longmangbaili is a large-scale inorganic fine chemical group, mainly engaged in the production and sales of titanium dioxide, titanium sponge, zirconium products and sulfuric acid. It is the largest titanium dioxide enterprise in Asia. For many years, the company’s industrial solid waste has been buried in Hekou Village, Liuzhuang Village, Sihou Village, etc. Due to the proximity to the village, local villagers questioned the environmental protection and safety of the project.</p><p>　　 In response to the above question, the Lomon Billion person did not respond to the reporter. They stated that the interview can be linked to the local government propaganda department, and the company does not respond.</p><p>“As the largest enterprise in the city, Lomonblade absolutely meets the environmental protection standards, and there will be no violations.” An official from the Zhongzhan District Ecological Environment Bureau told reporters that the industrial solid waste “yellow mud” procedures are complete, and the waste water has been since 2012. It has been discharged to the pollution treatment plant in the Zhongzhan District, with online monitoring. However, as of press time, the person has not provided reporters with the Lomon Billion project environmental assessment and other regulatory documents.</p><p>　　 Discharging waste to the “Mother River”?</p><p>　　Hekou Village is located at the foot of Taihang Mountain. In recent years, the rapid development of industry has disrupted the originally peaceful village life.</p><p>　　 The villagers of Hekou Village told reporters that Lomon Billion is close to the east side of the village, and every day a large amount of industrial waste and wastewater are buried and discharged, which may cause the soil and groundwater in the village to be polluted. On the east side, there was a ravine hundreds of meters deep, but it has long been filled with industrial waste.</p><p>　　 Originated from the Dasha River in the depths of the Taihang Mountains, known as the “Mother River” of Jiaozuo, it passes by the west side of Hekou Village. Villagers told reporters that Lomon Billion was suspected of discharging wastewater into Hanoi for many years.</p><p>　　 When the reporter found the sewage outlet of Lomon Billion to Dasha River that the villagers were referring to, there was still suspected waste water discharged from the sewage outlet. At the same time, the artificially dug ditches extended to the Dasha River, and the ditches accumulated a layer of yellowish-brown unidentified objects.</p><p>　　 Regarding the issue of wastewater discharge raised by the villagers, the reporter reported to the Zhongzhan District Ecological Environment Bureau and provided corresponding videos and photos.</p><p>　　 A person from the Central Station District Ecological Environment Bureau told reporters that the sewage outlet was previously used by Lomon Billion. After the construction of the sewage treatment plant in the middle station area in 2012, the company had already sealed the outlet.</p><p>　　 The person emphasized that it is impossible to say that it was Lomon Billion’s discharge at this time, and conclusions can only be drawn after investigation.</p><p>　　 A person in the titanium dioxide industry told reporters that the unknown matter in the river ditch was yellowish brown, which may be caused by the titanium dioxide wastewater containing iron ions. It is reported that the wastewater discharged from the production of titanium dioxide will contain substances such as sulfate and ferrous sulfate.</p><p>　　 The reporter learned that there is only one titanium dioxide company near Dasha River. Its capacity is mainly to produce titanium dioxide by the sulfuric acid process. As we all know, the sulfuric acid process has environmental pollution risks and high treatment costs. This is also an important reason for the development of the chlorination process by Lomon Billion in recent years.</p><p>　　 In addition, the villagers of Hekou Village told reporters that because solid waste filled the ravines, some companies started dumping industrial waste into the riverbed. The reporter saw at the scene that there was a pile of yellow mound not far from the sewage outlet on the wide river bed, and yellow-brown waste water could still be seen next to the mound.</p><p>　　 The reporter saw at the scene that Longmangbaili was built with its back on the mountain, Liuzhuang Village of Longxiang Sub-district Office in Zhongzhan District is located behind the mountain, and Sihou Village is on the east.</p><p>　　 According to villagers in Liuzhuang Village, Lomon Billion is on the mountain. The reporter saw trucks dumping solid waste into the valley at the top of the mountain, accompanied by white smoke.</p><p>　　 Local villagers said that the area from the south of the village to the foot of the mountain has been buried and covered with loess. Now landfill in the ravine on the north side of the village. During the reporter’s investigation, they saw trucks full of industrial solid waste driving north through the village.</p><p>　　 At the same time, there is also a buried ravine across the road on the south side of Sihou Village, which has been replanted in accordance with the policy. However, the reporter found on the top of the mountain above the ravine that industrial solid waste was still buried on it, overgrown with weeds, and yellow-brown industrial solid waste and a small amount of wastewater could be seen.</p><p>　　 Is the procedure missing?</p><p>　　 Regarding the above-mentioned villagers’ reports of Lomon Billion’s suspected pollution discharge and landfilling of solid waste, the reporter asked the Zhongzhan District Ecological Environment Bureau to verify whether they could provide the company’s relevant environmental assessment procedures and other documents. A source from the department told reporters that during the EIA procedures of Lomon Billion, the key was taken away due to a business trip by a colleague in the management materials room. It takes 4 days to come back and the colleague will provide it when he returns.</p><p>　　 In addition, the reporter asked the person to lead the people from the Ecological Environment Bureau to the Dasha River sewage outlet reported by the villagers. It said “no need” and said, “We all know the place and will check it out by ourselves, and will reply together at that time.” But as of press time, the department has not responded to reporters further, nor provided relevant EIA documents.</p><p>　　 If the EIA procedures are complete, why can’t it come out? A person from the Propaganda Department of the Zhongzhan District told reporters that the Ecology and Environment Bureau and the enterprises do not provide EIA materials because of too much pressure and fear of problems.</p><p>　　 It is understood that Lomon Billion is the largest local enterprise and a major taxpayer in the region.</p><p>　　 Public information shows that in 2017 and 2019, local media reported on the suspected discharge of waste water to Dasha River by the local media, and also reported to the local Ecology and Environment Bureau, but the feedback effect does not seem to be optimistic.</p><p>　　 An environmental law enforcement official told reporters that the wastewater problem is actually very easy to deal with. First, check the on-site inspection of wastewater to trace the root cause, and then find the company to check whether the water and drainage volume matches the capacity. If the amount of sewage discharged for so many years is very large, the comparative data is clear at a glance. The environmental impact assessment will have relevant regulations on drainage issues. An enterprise can only have one sewage outlet. If the enterprise discharges to a centralized sewage treatment plant, there will be no other sewage outlet.</p><p>Economist Song Qinghui told reporters that in fact, some polluting enterprises are the main pillars of local fiscal revenues. Some local governments, especially in economically underdeveloped areas, have “passed and passed” the pollution control enterprises, or practiced formalism, and are enjoying the increase in fiscal revenue. At the same time, villagers are allowed to bear the consequences of environmental pollution.</p><p>　　 Repeated violations were punished</p><p>　　 It is understood that the domestic titanium dioxide industry is dominated by the sulfuric acid process. The treatment of the “three wastes” is not difficult, but the treatment costs are high. The waste gas produced by the production of titanium dioxide is mainly acid mist and dust, etc., which can be effectively treated by spray washing and gravity sedimentation; the waste residue produced can be treated by techniques such as landfill and neutralization; ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, Waste acid, gypsum residue, etc. can be recycled or comprehensively utilized.</p><p>　　 “As the largest titanium dioxide company in China, if there is a large number of pollution problems, Lomon Billion will not only damage the ecological environment, but also seriously undermine fair competition in the industry.” Song Qinghui said in an interview with reporters.</p><p>　　 In fact, Lomonbali has repeatedly received “tickets” for environmental protection and safety issues in recent years.</p><p>　　 In 2019, Lomon Billion received the “Administrative Penalty Decision” issued by the Emergency Management Bureau of Jiaozuo City, Henan Province (Jiaoan Jianpu [2019] No. 72). The penalty decision letter shows that after the investigation of Jiaozuo City Emergency Management Bureau, the 1 million tons/year high-salt wastewater deep treatment project organized by Lomon Billion has been requested by Jiaozuo City Emergency Management Bureau to stop construction in the early stage, and no construction project has been obtained in the project. In the case of the safety review, the project is still under construction. Jiaozuo Emergency Management Bureau decided to fine Lomon Billion 1 million yuan.</p><p>　　 In addition, in 2019, Lomon Billion also received two “Administrative Penalty Decisions” issued by the Henan Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment. The “Administrative Penalty Decision” shows that Lomon Billions’ annual production line of sulfuric acid titanium dioxide production line with an annual output of 120,000 tons was put into production without environmental protection acceptance. In addition, the main project of the company’s annual production of 300,000 tons of sulfur-chlorine coupled titanium material green manufacturing project has been completed, power distribution facilities, electrical instrumentation systems and pipelines have not been completed, and the environmental impact assessment documents of the construction project have not been submitted according to law, and a fine of 400,000 yuan has been imposed , An administrative penalty of 1.3 million yuan.</p><p>　　 From 2017 to 2018, Lomon Titanium, a subsidiary of Lomon Billion Holdings, was punished by the local environmental protection department for 6 violations of laws and regulations. The penalties mainly involve solid waste, sewage, and waste gas treatment.</p><p>　　Among them, on August 3, 2018, the Environmental Protection Bureau of Mianzhu City, Sichuan carried out a law enforcement inspection on Lomon Titanium, and found that Lomon Titanium had 5000 cubic meters of leachate collection tank overflowing wastewater discharged without treatment when it rained at night. The monitoring report issued by the Deyang Environmental Monitoring Center Station showed that the pollutant indicators in the spilled wastewater exceeded the “Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard.” On March 30, 2017, Deyang City Environmental Monitoring Center Station conducted monitoring results of Lomon Titanium Industry. It was shown that the pH value of the effluent wastewater exceeded the national standard due to the malfunction of the pH alarm. Lomon Titanium Industry was fined 671,600 yuan.</p><p>　　 Song Qinghui told reporters that Lomon Billion’s large number of environmental penalties indicate that the company has “loopholes” in its management.</p><p>Since its listing in 2011, Lomon Billion has adhered to the development model of two-wheel drive of merger expansion and endogenous growth. It acquired Sichuan Lomon Titanium Industry Co., Ltd. in 2016 and Yunnan Metallurgical Xinli Titanium Industry Co., Ltd. in 2019. Formed an operation and management model centered on the group headquarters and coordinated with the six production bases.</p><p>　　 In this regard, the development goal of deep integration between Lomon Billion and its subsidiaries has put forward higher requirements to the group’s management. Lomon Billion also said that the macroeconomic environment is becoming increasingly complex and changeable. If the company cannot continue to improve its management and decision-making efficiency, it may have a certain impact on the company’s normal production and operation.</p>]]></content>

In the future, the existing mine production will decrease with the decline in reserves and grades. According to Iluka and TZMI, the waste composition of mineral sand resources under exploration continues to increase, while the accumulation of rutile/zircon continues to decline. In terms of production capacity, the supply of titanium ore will shrink in the future, and the unit cost will increase accordingly. Iluka’s unit titanium raw material cost has risen for two consecutive years, and Kenmare also expects the unit cost of titanium raw material to increase from 2019. Rio Tinto also expects the overall supply and demand balance of titanium ore in 2019.<br>Since then, the overall supply of titanium ore (high-grade + low-grade) has shown a downward trend. The overall demand growth rate for titanium raw materials is expected to be 2.3%. The above analysis shows that Rio Tinto’s judgment on the 2.3% demand growth rate for titanium raw materials is not optimistic.<br><img src="/2020/11/27/Supply-of-titanium-is-expected-to-remain-tight-for-the-next-two-years/tio2-demand-supply.png" alt="Rio Tinto expects the overall supply of titanium raw materials (high-grade and low-grade) to decline after 2020, and the overall demand for titanium raw materials is expected to grow by 2.3 percent, RESOURCE: Riotinto, TZMI, DONGXING SECURITIES"><br>Iluka expect 2019 to be the critical point of supply and demand for high-grade titanium ores. Based on the expansion advantage of future chlorination method over sulfuric acid method, the annual demand growth rate of high-grade titanium ores in the next five years is about 5%. The production of high-grade chloride raw materials will decrease from 2019, assuming that the capacity utilization ratio of idle titanium slag reaches 75%, and the annual output growth rate of high-grade chloride raw materials in the next five years is only about 1%, which is difficult to meet the demand.<img src="/2020/11/27/Supply-of-titanium-is-expected-to-remain-tight-for-the-next-two-years/global-high-grade-chloride-titanium-feedstocks-supply-outlook.png" alt="Even if idle capacity is restarted at 75% operating rate, the future growth rate of high-grade raw material supply is expected to be 1% a year, still lower than the annual growth rate of 5% of high-grade raw material demand, RESOURCE: Iluka, TZMI, DONGXING SECURITIES"></p><ul><li>Note: according to the TZMI forecast, the demand for high grade chloride raw materials will increase by about 5% per year in the next five years; figures 11 and 12 do not include Iluka high grade raw materials items.</li></ul><p><img src="/2020/11/27/Supply-of-titanium-is-expected-to-remain-tight-for-the-next-two-years/forcast-supply-demand-market-balance.jpg" alt="Kenmare projections of future supply and demand gaps (changes in inventory).

Therefore, Less than 150000 tons of titanium concentrate per year can only meet the demand of about 60,000 tons of titanium dioxide, Far from  200,000 tons of titanium dioxide a year, And during 2021 2022 due to the existence of replenishment stocks, The apparent demand is expected to be greater than the real demand.</p>]]></content>

From January to August 2020, the cumulative export volume of titanium dioxide was close to 780,000 tons, a significant year-on-year increase of 18.36%. It is expected that the total export volume for the year will exceed 1.2 million tons, setting a new historical record. To be sure, the export to the international market is still a very important factor supporting the prosperity of titanium dioxide in the latter part of this year and in the future.<br>As the price of titanium ore continues to run at a high level, the current price of titanium ore in Panxi has reached 298 usd/ton (EXW &amp; not VAT), causing the production costs of major domestic titanium dioxide producers to continue to increase, forcing titanium dioxide producers to continuously adjust their Product prices, coupled with the renewed large-scale outbreak of the global new crown virus, has caused overseas shipping prices to continue to skyrocket, which has caused the domestic titanium dioxide CIF prices to continue to rise, further reducing the price gap with international titanium dioxide suppliers. In addition, due to RMB since the second half of this year Continued appreciation, these reasons have had a certain impact on the export of titanium dioxide in early 2021, so we remain cautious about the export situation in early 2021.</p><h2 id="The-current-domestic-titanium-dioxide-market-situation"><a href="#The-current-domestic-titanium-dioxide-market-situation" class="headerlink" title="The current domestic titanium dioxide market situation:"></a>The current domestic titanium dioxide market situation:</h2><ol><li>The supply of domestic titanium dioxide manufacturers is still very tight, basically every one has no inventory, and the supply to first-level agents has also been reduced by 20%-30%.

Australian titanium concentrate rarely flows into China again.<br>Kenya’s output began to decrease in 2019. Further reduction in 2020.<br>It can be seen that in recent years, foreign high-quality titanium slag has entered the Chinese market with a decreasing trend year by year. At the same time, Kenya Base Resources expects that for the 21st fiscal year, the output from July to June 2020 will be only 270,000 tons.<br>It will further reduce the entry of foreign high-quality titanium slag into the Chinese market, especially the high-titanium slag materials suitable for the chloride process will further reduce the entry into the Chinese market.</p><h1 id="China-domestic-sistuation"><a href="#China-domestic-sistuation" class="headerlink" title="China domestic sistuation"></a>China domestic sistuation</h1><h2 id="Panxi-Region-Abstract"><a href="#Panxi-Region-Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Panxi Region Abstract:"></a>Panxi Region Abstract:</h2><p>Panxi Vanadium-titanium Magnetite Mine: Located in the southwest of Sichuan Province, it includes more than 20 counties and cities including Panzhihua and Liangshan Prefecture. The Panxi area is a huge titanium cornucopia. Its proven reserves of titanium resources are 1/4 of the world’s. It is accompanied by a dozen rare and precious metals such as vanadium, titanium, cobalt, and gallium. The proven vanadium-titanium magnetite is about 9.8×109 t, and the titanium dioxide reserves are 8.73×108 t. Average grade TiO2 content of slag 5%.</p><h2 id="Panxi-Region-2020-Production-report"><a href="#Panxi-Region-2020-Production-report" class="headerlink" title="Panxi Region 2020 Production report"></a>Panxi Region 2020 Production report</h2><p>It is estimated that the actual production of titanium slag in Panxi area in 2020 will be about 3.5-3.6 million tons, and the output will be reduced by about 150,000 to 200,000 tons compared with 2019. As the nature of titanium slag in Panxi area is only suitable for sulfuric acid titanium dioxide production, Panxi The trend of regional titanium slag will directly affect the trend of the domestic titanium dioxide market.</p><ol><li>The actual output of Panzhihua Iron and Steel’s contract processing plant continued to decline due to the further tension of raw slag. The raw slag in 2021 will remain highly tight.</li><li>In 2020, the production of Xichang Taihe was not very smooth due to maintenance and other reasons, which directly affected the supply of about 100,000-120,000 tons.</li><li>Panzhihua Iron and Steel’s tailings pond relocation, due to potential safety hazards in Panzhihua’s original tailings pond, Pangang will temporarily transition to Fengyuan tailings pond, which will cause tailings emissions from nearby titanium slag producers. The surrounding titanium slag producers have caused a very large impact, which may cause the surrounding producers to further reduce production.</li><li>In 2021, Lomon Billions Group’s Panzhihua 500,000-ton high-titanium slag project is expected to be officially put into operation in May, which will further cause a shortage of Panzhihua titanium slag supply.</li><li>There will be no new titanium slag production capacity in Panxi area in 2021. Due to the further reduction in slag supply, it is expected that the supply of titanium slag will be further reduced in 2021, and it is expected that titanium slag price will maintain a high level trend.</li><li>Due to the newly added titanium slag projects, including the Lonmon Billions Group’s high-titanium slag project, the amount of titanium slag required for the new production capacity of other titanium dioxide, it is expected that in 2021 there will be about 630,000 tons of titanium slag gap which will force titanium dioxide factories to turn to imported titanium slag. Therefore, it is expected that the entire titanium slag market, including the imported titanium slag market, will maintain a high degree of tight supply in 2021, and the price will continue to run at a high level, without a very obvious price downward signal.</li></ol><h2 id="Other-titanium-related-industry-brief"><a href="#Other-titanium-related-industry-brief" class="headerlink" title="Other titanium related industry brief"></a>Other titanium related industry brief</h2><p>In 2020, the domestic titanium sponge market will be completely different from the international market. Foreign related industries such as titanium sponge and titanium materials will be in a downturn. The domestic market expects that the output of titanium sponge will reach 100,000 tons. The market began to appear in June. Continued price increases have stimulated the rise in the titanium tetrachloride market.<br>In 2020, the welding electrode industry and the reduced titanium industry will basically maintain the same market conditions as in 2019, and there will be no major changes. However, there will be new suppliers of artificial rutile, and production will be gradually released, such as the 100,000-ton artificial rutile project in Guangdong Maoming Yueqiao.</p><h2 id="Future-Outlook-of-Titanium-Industry"><a href="#Future-Outlook-of-Titanium-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Future Outlook of Titanium Industry"></a>Future Outlook of Titanium Industry</h2><ol><li>The domestic market of titanium dioxide will remain cautiously optimistic. It is expected that the supply will ease in April 2021, but the production cost will remain high.</li><li>The titanium dioxide market segment will gradually increase. For example, Huiyun Titanium Industry will invest in a new plastic-specific titanium dioxide production line (currently no more public information)</li><li>The construction of chlorinated titanium dioxide will enter a period of rapid expansion. For example, Dinglong Culture will invest in new 500,000 tons of chlorinated titanium dioxide (the specific implementation details are not announced in the announcement)</li><li>Domestic titanium dioxide suppliers will further prepare their export plans and continue to increase their export shares to ensure the operation of their factories.</li><li>If no more titanium dioxide applications are developed in the next 2-3 years, the domestic titanium dioxide market will have very large industry competition.</li><li>Imported titanium slag will maintain the current situation without significant increase and substantial reduction, but in the long run, high-quality imported titanium slag will still further decrease.</li><li>The slag supply in Panzhihua area and the influence of Panzhihua Iron and Steel Tailings Pond will continue to operate at a higher price in the next 1-2 years. The estimated price range is 230usd/ton—305usd/ton.</li><li>Overall, the supply in Panxi will remain tight in the next 2-3 years, mainly due to the increase in the amount of titanium slag required for the production of new titanium dioxide and the gradual decrease in the supply of raw slag. It is difficult to change within. Titanium slag market in Panxi region remains optimistic in the future</li></ol><p>Reported by:<br>Ronald W.<br>Tinox Senior Market analyst</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, the entire industry market has undergone strong changes. The domestic construction industry is basically still in the unopened state, which directly and indirectly causes the demand for coatings and titanium dioxide to be greatly reduced, and domestic sales are basically very difficult.<br>Due to the outbreak of foreign epidemics, basically all countries have adopted measures to close the country to prevent the epidemic from further out of control. Therefore, overseas sales of titanium dioxide are basically at a standstill. As a result, the domestic sales of titanium dioxide in April were not very optimistic, especially the price of titanium dioxide in the first-tier domestic manufacturers fell sharply in April, and the market price was in chaos. At the same time, the latest price is already close to its cost price. Will stay for a long time. But on the other hand, many domestic factories have begun to fully restore their production capacity. It is expected that the actual output of titanium dioxide factories will reach a higher level in May. At the same time, it is expected that the price of titanium dioxide will steadily decrease partly, not as large as in April. Adjust the price by a margin. In addition, due to the gradual control of the domestic epidemic situation, the resumption of production and production in various industries will continue to improve, and the sales of titanium dioxide will gradually rebound.<br><img src="https://tinoxchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-Chinese-tio2-price.png" alt="2020 Chinese TiO2 Price"></p><p>In 2020, the titanium ore market rose directly from 1400 yuan at the beginning of the year to 1550-1600 yuan. The main reason is that the purchase volume of titanium ore has increased significantly. Due to the very tight purchase of ore, the supply of raw materials for medium ore is very tight, which has pushed up the price of medium ore. Titanium suppliers’ reluctance to sell gradually increased from January 2020 to the end of February to 1550-1600 yuan, and then the willingness of titanium dioxide factories to purchase titanium ore was gradually lowered due to the impact of the epidemic, resulting in the gradual price of titanium ore in Panzhihua region. Down, the 10 mines in the Panzhihua area as of April 27, 2020 have fallen to around 1,350 yuan.<br>It is expected that the titanium ore market in May will stabilize with the changes in the titanium dioxide market, and prices will not be adjusted significantly, and the balance of supply and demand for titanium ore will be further stabilized. At the same time, imported titanium ore, especially high-grade titanium ore, will maintain the current price. Due to various reasons, imported high-grade titanium ore will not undergo major price changes due to the epidemic situation. The supply of imported titanium ore is relatively comparative tension.<br><img src="https://tinoxchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-Chinese-ilmenite-price.png" alt="2020 Chinese ilmenite price"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the last day of Feb.2020, the team of paintindia2020 finally announced the postponement which was recognized as the influence of the global rising coronavirus.<br><img src="http://tinoxchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/postponement.png"><br>The PAINTINDIA series of exhibitions, since their inception in 1993, have been the pioneering and premier coatings exposition for the coatings industry in the Indian sub-continent. PaintIndia has built a place for itself as the pioneer and the only journal in the coating industry not only in India, but in the entire Far East. It has all along championed the cause of the coating industry to the extent that the Indian Industry looks upto the journal for objective presentation of news, independent expression of views and dissemination of information in continuing research in coatings and raw materials, and its allied fields.<br>“Now the postponement of PAINTINDIA could lead to a more cloudy India market of paint &amp; coatings industry” The experienced market analysits said, “The coronavirus is being controlled in China, and the export of China will soon recover together with their domestic needs, but globally the virus deeply influenced the business activity by which the market sky of raw material for paint &amp; coatings industry, such as titanium dioxide, could be in a longterm cloudy and grey”.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>TINOX R-2280, a high-performance SP-rutile TiO2 pigment for plastic applications gives outstanding optical<br>properties and is also optimized due to post-treatment for required use at higher process temperatures.</p></blockquote><h2 id="R-2280-pigment-surface"><a href="#R-2280-pigment-surface" class="headerlink" title="R-2280 pigment surface"></a>R-2280 pigment surface</h2><p>Organic post-treatments of TiO2 pigments generally <img src="http://tinoxchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/masterbatch.png"><br>improve dispersibility because deagglomeration and wetting of the pigment surface are promoted. Undesired interactions between the polymer and pigment can be suppressed and, above all, the demands on shear forces in the dispersion process are reduced. This leads to maximum optical properties and the most efficient use in the plastic end product.<br>Inorganic post-treatments are mainly carried out to improve certain properties of the end product and also improve the dispersion properties. By forming a barrier between the titanium dioxide surface and the matrix resin, they inhibit undesirable chemical reactions.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“The special organic post-treatment of TINOX R-2280 improves the wetting behavior in extrusion process. The<br>applied inorganic aluminum post-treatment also contributes to this.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>The general qualitative statement that a TiO2 pigment is provided with inorganic and organic post-treatment is not<br>sufficient to derive excellent process capability in the extrusion process.<br>Organic post-treatment substances that have been applied to a high degree can separate from the TiO2-pigment<br>despite conventional process temperatures and migrate to or near the surface of the pigmented plastic. If this<br>happens, the product properties and also the state of dispersion are impaired.<br>Aluminum compounds are usually used for the inorganic post-treatment in amounts of 0.5 to 4%, calculated as<br>Al2O3. An Al2O3 posttreatment is compatible with all common binders and is unproblematic from this point of view.<br>Nevertheless, a portion of “crystal water” can outgas, especially at elevated process temperatures, whereby<br>technically a portion of water vapor forms in the melt. For this reason, it is advantageous if plastics TiO2 grades<br>have a not too high aluminum oxide post-treatment at process temperatures above 270 ° C.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“TINOX R-2280 was developed taking into account all expected interface interactions.<br>The low volatile components of TINOX R-2280, tested at high temperatures, clearly demonstrate the successful<br>optimization with regard to the type and amount of post-treatment.

The organic post-treatment of TINOX R-2280 lowers<br>the surface energy of the pigment surface which improves the dispersibility in plastic applications.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Increased fine particle size of a pigment also requires higher dispersion energy input or longer residence times of<br>the pigment in the shear zones. The higher number of agglomerates of small sizes requires a higher probability of<br>staying in the dispersion process in order to completely disperse the TiO2 pigment and to fully utilize the performance of tinting strength and opacity.</p><p>The use or the modified addition of effective process additives opens up possibilities for optimizing the dispersion<br>process. However the effort of renewed evaluations and the control of the impact on further subsequent process steps and end products are good arguments that such activities are usually not the top priority.</p><p>The energy input required for dispersion can be controlled via the process parameters speed of the extruder screw and the temperature curve along the extruder screw. Regardless of whether extrusion premix(1) or split-feeding(2) process, pigments are incorporated into a plastic melt in stirring screws of different temperature zones.Agglomerates are dispersed faster, the larger they are, the higher the shear rate and shear stress and the lower the agglomerate strength.</p><p><img src="http://tinoxchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/extrusion-premix.png" alt="Figure 1: Schematic representation of the extrusion premix process(1) and "></p><p>The extrusion process runs with an increasing temperature gradient over the zones in which the materials are<br>drawn in, over into the zone of melting / plasticizing and finally into the homogenization zone in which the actual<br>dispersion process takes place due to shear forces acting on the melt. The result of the dispersion is determined,<br>among other things, by the input of the mechanical dispersion power. The local temperature and other process<br>variables such as the torque built up are control variables for the mechanical energy input.</p><p><img src="http://tinoxchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/extruder-screw-configuration.png" alt="Figure 2: Influence of the screw speed on the dwell time T. After adding a tracer, "><br>The viscosity of the melt can be controlled by the temperature gradient along the extrusion axis, high temperatures producing low viscosities of the plastic melt. As the screw speed<br>increases, the shear rate is the dominant influence on the deagglomeration of the pigment in the plastic melt. In contrast, lower temperatures in the extruder screw produce higher viscosities of the plastic melt, which leads to increased deagglomeration due to increasing shear stresses in the plastic melt leads.In this case, a higher torque is measured at constant screw speed.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“The high optimized fine particle size of R-2280, which leads to the excellent bluish pigment properties, may<br>require an increased energy input into the extrusion process in certain applications. Increasing screw speed<br>leads to a shorter residence time and thus to a reduction in the probability of agglomerates staying in the shear<br>zones. For this reason, a slight reduction in the temperature in suitable zones of the screw can lead to improved<br>dispersion due to higher viscosities of the plastic melt and the associated increasing shear stresses”</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>TINOX R-2280 was developed taking into account all expected interface interactions.<br>The low volatile components of TINOX R-2280, tested at high temperatures, clearly demonstrate the successful<br>optimization with regard to the type and amount of post-treatment. In particular, the optimized aluminum<br>post-treatment of R-2280 reduces the occurrence of “lacing” in the production of thin foils.<br>Fine TiO2-particles tend to agglomerate. If the TiO2 agglomerates are not dispersed in the plastic matrix, the<br>positive properties such as lightening capacity and opacity cannot develop fully. For this reason, the complete and<br>homogeneous dispersion of titanium dioxide pigment in plastics is an important task in the production of<br>TiO2-pigmented plastics.<br>TINOX R-2280 is a rutile TiO2 pigment from the sulfate process which produces bluish optical properties in the<br>pigmented plastic that are well above average. The bluish optical properties are generated by an optimized and<br>finely divided particle size distribution. Numerous variations within the screw configuration of the dispersion zone<br>can be carried out with relatively little effort and the influence of individual shear elements on the process<br>variables can be determined.<br>An optimized and high fine particle size of TiO2 pigment particles, which leads for example to the excellent bluish<br>pigment properties of R-2280, may require an increased energy input into the extrusion process in certain<br>applications. By control of screw speed and srew-temperature during the extrusion process the dispersion result<br>can be controled</p><hr><p>Footnotes</p><ol><li>In the “premix process”, all raw materials are usually cold mixed using different mixing methods. In addition to cold mixing, the hot mixing process is<br>practiced, albeit more rarely. The premix is usually metered volumetrically via screw conveyors into the extruder feed. Due to the high pigment<br>concentrations, the use of powdered polymer is common to ensure statistical particle distribution. In addition, granules take significantly longer to<br>melt in the extruders and, through pigment compaction in the feed area, increase the risk of irreversible agglomerates that can no longer be shredded<br>by shearing.</li><li>In the “split feeding process”, the individual components are added to different extruder openings</li></ol><p>January 10th 2020<br><a href="http://www.tinoxchem.com/">Tinox Chemie GmbH</a><br>Emanuel-Leutze-Str. 21<br>40547 Düsseldorf，Germany<br>Tel Nr. : +49(0)211 52809600<br>Email : <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#97;&#108;&#x65;&#64;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#x78;&#99;&#x68;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x65;">&#x73;&#97;&#108;&#x65;&#64;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#x78;&#99;&#x68;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x2e;&#x64;&#x65;</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the whole year of 2019, China’s titanium dioxide market experienced five stages of ups and downs. At the end of the year, the price has fallen to a certain extent compared with the beginning of the year. At present, the price of Chinese rutile titanium dioxide FOB price is 1950.00 usd/ton—2200 usd/ton, anatase titanium dioxide FOB is from 1700 usd/ton to 1800 usd/ton. Among them, the market price of Lonmong Billions announced a total of 4 times price increase, respectively on February 12, March 7, August 15, and September 3. The declines were in January, July, and November.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/12/16/bLvdTCRulDW9SXk.png" alt="China market TiO2 price trend in 2019 (Jan. to Nov., FOB CN port)"><br>After entering December, due to the suspension of operation of Richards Bay in South Africa, the situation of raw materials is further strained. At the same time, due to the increasing cost of titanium raw materials manufacturers in China, titanium dioxide manufacturers have to consider whether to conduct price increases or halt for maintenance. At present, Most manufacturers have chosen the former and announced price increases ranging from 30-50 usd/ton to offset the cost pressure brought by the continuous price increase of titanium raw materials.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/12/16/SZtfnmIToxUzqgL.png" alt="Chinese tio2 import and export from 2008-2019"><br>In January 2020, due to the traditional Chinese New Year holiday, China’s titanium dioxide market is expected to maintain the current price increase trend. At the same time, the titanium dioxide supply may be in short and tight in general. It is expected that large-scale price increases will occur in February. At the same time, due to the influence of titanium raw materials, the production cost of chlorinated titanium dioxide will be greatly increased, and the supply of high-quality titanium ore and high slag will continue to be tight.</p><p>Roland Wong, Market Researcher<br><a href="http://www.tinoxchem.com/">TINOX CHEMIE GMBH</a><br>Dusseldorf, Germany</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rio Tinto announced on December 4 that Rio Tinto Group announced that it had suspended its mining operations and expansion projects at Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa due to escalating violence in surrounding communities. Suspended. This event will directly affect the global titanium raw material market, especially the future trend of the high slag raw material market of chlorinated titanium dioxide. At the same time, the production of titanium slag by the Norwegian titanium slag production plant is not very smooth, so the future titanium slag market is very severe and tight. The price of raw materials for chlorinated titanium dioxide will remain high in the future, and the production cost of chlorinated titanium dioxide will continue to increase. After China’s titanium dioxide market entered the traditional off-season, two divergences occurred. Some manufacturers carried out price increases due to the cost of raw materials, while other manufacturers threw out goods in order to clean up some inventory. However, under the pressure of high-priced raw materials, most of China’s titanium dioxide manufacturers are not willing to conduct price reductions but instead enter the state of parking and maintenance. At the same time, most titanium dioxide manufacturers’ products are relatively tight, and titanium dioxide products are out of stock in the market. <strong>The situation is still very grim, so in the traditional off-season, some manufacturers announced price increases, of which two chlorinated titanium dioxide manufacturers announced a price increase of 80-100usd, and another sulfated titanium dioxide manufacturer announced a price increase of 50usd.</strong></p><h2 id="Future-market-judgment"><a href="#Future-market-judgment" class="headerlink" title="Future market judgment:"></a>Future market judgment:</h2><p>Due to the suspension of the operation of Richards Bay Mining Company of South Africa, and according to Kenmare, the supply of high-grade titanium ore in 2020 will be very tight, and there will be no excess supply to high-slag producers and the chlorination method. Titanium dioxide factory, it is expected that the future price of chlorinated titanium dioxide market will mainly increase prices to offset the pressure brought by the cost of raw materials. It is expected that the chlorinated method will increase by about 80-120 US dollars in the near future. The future trend of high-grade titanium ore resources and high-titanium slag will continue to be tight, and it will continue to bring continuous raw material cost pressures to producers of chlorinated titanium dioxide.</p><p>Roland Wong, Market Researcher<br><a href="http://www.tinoxchem.com/">TINOX CHEMIE GMBH</a><br>Dusseldorf, Germany</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="First-Market-Analysis"><a href="#First-Market-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="First, Market Analysis"></a>First, Market Analysis</h2><p>It was almost completed in November. It was identified as a weak titanium dioxide market after the Shanghai Coatings Exhibition. The end market has severely reduced prices, and the price market has become increasingly clear. Some manufacturers have adjusted their prices after the meeting. Panzhihua Haifengxin Chemical announced a rise of 200 yuan / ton against the trend, which aroused the attention of many people. The main reason for the increase is the high cost of raw materials and the shortage of spot supply in the market. The force is not strong, and the initial intention is obvious.</p><p>At present, the spot prices of manufacturers in Shandong, Anhui, Panzhihua and other regions continue to be tight. These manufacturers have maintained stable prices since the first drop in early November. In fact, the price adjustment is also very reluctant. On the one hand, they must adapt to market trends and maintain reasonable prices for first-tier brands. On the other hand, spot supply is tight due to low operating rates and other reasons. In long and short situations, the big picture can be the focus. Foreign trade, terminals and channels have different supply priorities.</p><p>The price market is gradually rationalizing, and the obvious performance is that the market price gradient is obvious. The price difference of similar products is about 1,500 yuan / ton, and the price span has gradually narrowed. The market price positioning of products is mainly determined by value, supply and demand relationship, and value is determined by quality, brand, psychological expectations and many other factors. Matching titanium dioxide at any price. The focus is on quality. The psychological expectation is that big brands are high-quality and expensive. </p><blockquote><p>[The export volume of titanium dioxide in October 2019 decreased by 5.26% month-on-month]</p></blockquote><p>According to the statistics provided by the General Administration of Customs, China’s imports of titanium dioxide in October 2019 were 18,240.04 tons, a 63% increase from the previous month and a 10.77% increase from the same period last year. The average import price for the month was USD2902.04/ton. From January to October 2019, the cumulative import volume of titanium dioxide was 130508.04 tons, and the cumulative average import price was 3011.27 USD/ton, a YoY decrease of 18.86%.

From January to October 2019, the cumulative export volume of titanium dioxide was 820,784.14 tons, and the cumulative average export price was USD2,222.35/ton, a YoY increase of 5.82%.</p><blockquote><p>[Lonmonbillions: Xinli Titanium Industry will resume design capacity as soon as possible]</p></blockquote><p>On November 22, Lonmonbillions (002601) answered investors’ questions on the interactive platform and stated that Yunnan Metallurgical Xinli Titanium Industry Co., Ltd. has an annual output of 60,000 tons of titanium dioxide, 10,000 tons of titanium sponge per year and 80,000 Ton. With three production lines per ton / year of high titanium slag, the company will resume the design capacity as soon as possible.</p><p>Currently, most China domestic rutile sulfates and anatase titanium dioxides are priced at RMB 13,500-15500 / t and RMB 11,500-12500 / t. The China domestic and imported rutile titanium dioxide is 17500-20000 according to the application amount. RMB / ton and RMB 25,000-27,000 / ton (the above are all spot prices without tax).</p><p>According to foreign media reports, on the afternoon of November 27, Beijing time, a chemical plant in PortNeches, Texas, exploded, and nearby residents were evacuated. No casualties were reported, but an explosion was reported in the Huntsman chemical plant, which damaged nearby buildings. According to TPC’s website, there are more than 200 people working here. The plant produces butadiene (combustible gas used to produce synthetic rubber (12640, 70.00, 0.56%)) and other petrochemical products, such as butane.</p><p>Yan Titanium industry analysts believe that the explosion has no impact on the titanium dioxide market. Huntsman did explode, but it was not a titanium dioxide factory. More precisely, Huntsman has no titanium dioxide business. In 1998, the United States Huntsman Corporation (HUNTSMAN) acquired a 70% stake in Tioxide Group PLG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Empire Chemical Industry Corporation (ICI), and TIOXIDE titanium dioxide has since belonged to HUNTSMAN. On July 24, 2017, Venator was born out of Huntsman in the United States and independently operated Huntsman’s titanium dioxide and high-performance additive business.</p><h2 id="Second-market-outlook"><a href="#Second-market-outlook" class="headerlink" title="Second, market outlook"></a>Second, market outlook</h2><p>This week, the China domestic titanium dioxide price market is weak. Yan Xun, an analyst with Yan Titanium and Titanium, believes that November has closed, and the price market in the post-coating exhibition era is gradually clear. A few personalized operations are expected to have little impact on the price market. The price market at the beginning of December is more critical and directly affects the foundation of the multi-year market. Most manufacturers and distributors mainly collect payments. Most of the orders with small profits but quick turnover and fast-in and fast-out may be born in December. Some holders are The sales volume and receipts of the business may be increased, or unconventional prices may appear, but most terminals are more rational. In the short term, the price market at the beginning of December was mainly stalemate and stabilized. Individual orders were negotiated with the amount of use and the form of payment. When the buyer and the seller meet their needs, all prices are reasonable.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On 4 October, the European Commission decided to classify titanium dioxide in powder form as a substance “suspected of causing cancer in humans”.</p><p>This follows <a href="https://tio2.info/2019/09/25/Majority-of-EU-countries-vote-against-Commission-proposal-on-titanium-dioxide-classification/">an expert hearing (CARACAL) in September</a> in which several EU Member States rejected the classification of titanium dioxide as a carcinogenic. In addition to being classified in category 2 as substance “suspected of causing cancer in humans”, the pigment is added to the list of substances under the Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP).</p><p>Thus, titanium dioxide placed on the market in powder form would have to be labelled as carcinogenic. The classification would also apply to powdered mixtures containing titanium dioxide particles. Liquid mixtures, including coatings, paints and printing inks, should include a warning on their packaging regarding spray applications. If no objection is lodged by the Council or the European Parliament within the next two months, the classification will become valid after a transitional period of 18 months, i.e. probably from summer 2021 on.</p><p>The classification meets with strong criticism from the coatings and printing ink industry. Martin Engelmann of the German Paints and Printing Inks Industry Association (VdL) said there were “serious doubts” about the legality of the Commission proposal.</p><h2 id="Event-tips"><a href="#Event-tips" class="headerlink" title="Event tips"></a>Event tips</h2><p>The current status of titanium dioxide will also be discussed at the <a href="https://www.european-coatings.com/Events/EC-Regulatory-Forum/Conference-schedule/">European Coatings Regulatory Forum on 27 and 28 November in Brussels</a>. David Lockley of Venator / Titanium Dioxide Manufacturers Association gives updates and talks about the consequences for the coatings industry. The conference will also address other regulatory challenges such as poison information centres, Brexit and much more.</p><p>Titanium dioxide will also be the focus of <a href="https://www.european-coatings.com/Events/EC-TiO2-Forum-Bright-opaque-and-irreplaceable/">the EC TiO2 Forum on 28 and 29 January in Berlin</a>. The conference will look at the pigment from a technical point of view, but will deal with alternatives and innovations in the field of TiO2.</p>]]></content>

In a new work, Na-P-zeolite was prepared from kaolin and subjected to a cation-exchange process to replace Na+ by Cu2+ and/or Zn2+ to achieve anticorrosive and antibacterial effects. In situ emulsion polymerisation of vinyl acetate-vinyl versatate (VAc-VEOVA) copolymer at the nanoscale with P-zeolite and Zn-, Cu-, Zn/Cu-cation-exchanged P-zeolites was then applied to obtain P-zeolite-(VAc-VEOVA), Zn-P-zeolite-(VAc-VEOVA), Cu-P-zeolite-(VAc-VEOVA), and Zn/Cu-P-zeolite-(VAc-VEOVA) nanocomposites.</p><p>Mixed (Zn/Cu)-P-zeolite with best anticorrosive and antibacterial performance<br>Anticorrosive and antibacterial tests were then carried out on films containing the different nanocomposites using laboratory accelerated testing, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the disc well diffusion method with different types of Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G−) bacteria, revealing that the film containing the mixed (Zn/Cu)-P-zeolite showed the best anticorrosive and antibacterial performance.</p><p>The study is published in: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11998-019-00202-9?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals&utm_source=toc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=toc_11998_16_5">Journal of Coatings Technology and Research, September 2019, Volume 16, Issue 5, pp 1263–1281.</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an expert hearing (CARACAL) last week, several EU Member States rejected the classification of titanium dioxide as carcinogenic. However, the Commission has announced that it will continue the process anyway.<br>A total of nine EU Member States have rejected the regulatory package for various reasons. However, it is not the case that the rejecting countries all reject the classification for the same reasons. There are, for example, countries that tend to reject labelling in principle, but there are also a few that regard labelling as too lax.</p><p>On the other hand, six Member States voted in favour. The Commission’s current proposal provides that liquid mixtures should not be labelled, but powder coatings should be.</p><h2 id="commission-to-go-on-alone"><a href="#commission-to-go-on-alone" class="headerlink" title="commission to go on alone"></a>commission to go on alone</h2><p>Under new procedural rules, however, the Commission can also decide on the classification itself without the agreement of the Member States, which it probably intends to do. It remains controversial, however, whether the EU Commission is obliged to carry out a prior impact assessment, as the industry demands. Industry representatives criticised in particular the unintended consequences of the classification. In the meantime, there is increasing pressure on the Commission to first analyse the consequences of classification. An appeal has been signed by 300 companies and associations. </p><p>According to a recent announcement by the German Press Agency (dpa), the Commission plans to take the formal decision as early as October. After that, the industry would be granted at least 20 months’ notice to implement the obligation. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Powder coatings have good environmental properties and excellent coating results. This article introduces how to choose titanium white pigments suitable for powder coatings. It is recommended to consider the following properties of titanium dioxide: (1) the type of titanium dioxide; (2) the surface treatment of titanium dioxide; (3) the particle size distribution of titanium dioxide; (4) pH value of titanium dioxide; (5) water content of titanium dioxide.</p><h1 id="Part-1-Introduction"><a href="#Part-1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Introduction"></a>Part 1: Introduction</h1><p>With the increase of environmental protection in China, the coating industry has gradually developed into high-solids coatings and water-based coatings. Powder coatings are representative of solvent-free high-solids coatings<sup>[1]</sup>, and their volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions are much lower than traditional solvent-based coatings. Some products have achieved zero VOC emissions; It is an environmentally friendly coating that produces little solid waste during the coating process and prevents air pollution and fire.</p><p>Powder coatings are made by uniformly mixing polymers such as polyester resin, polyurethane, polyacrylic acid, and epoxy resin with pigments, additives, etc. <sup>[2]</sup>. Powder coatings are easy to construct, generally only need one coating to meet the requirements of use. In the case of excellent coating process control, the film does not produce pores, acid and alkali resistance, corrosion resistance; powder coating equipment volume Small, small footprint, comprehensive investment of complete sets of equipment is smaller than traditional solvent-based coatings; powder coatings are not flammable, safer, convenient, simple and economical in use, storage and transportation; oversprayed coating powder can also be recycled and reused; Powder coatings have received extensive attention since the invention due to the above advantages. The coating process of powder coating can be divided into powder fluidized bed coating method, electrostatic spraying method, electrostatic oscillation method, currentized bed method, low-capacity electrostatic cloud chamber method, powder electrophoresis method and flame spraying method. The electrostatic powder coating method is currently the most widely used due to its high powder utilization rate, easy automation, and smooth coating on both the tip and the rough surface of the workpiece. Industries mainly based on powder coating include furniture manufacturing, home appliance kitchen manufacturing, steel pipe industry, automobile industry, agricultural machinery industry, fire equipment, motor industry and construction industry.</p><h1 id="Part-2-The-natrure-of-titanium-dioxide"><a href="#Part-2-The-natrure-of-titanium-dioxide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The natrure of titanium dioxide"></a>Part 2: The natrure of titanium dioxide</h1><p>The main component of titanium dioxide is TiO2, which is the best white pigment pigment <sup>[3-7]</sup>. Because of its higher refractive index, the ability to deflect light is greater than other white pigments, so it has better hiding power in coating applications. The refractive indices of common white pigments are shown in Table 1. The coating function prepared by titanium dioxide covers the substrate, beautifies the substrate, protects the substrate, and avoids the rust and corrosion of the substrate by the influence of light, heat and moisture. All in all, the basic performance of titanium dioxide in the industry is “coverage-beautification-protection”.</p><table>    <tr style="text-align:center">        Chart 1 Refractive index of common white pigments    </tr>   <tr>        <th width=25% style="text-align:center">Material</th>        <th width=25% style="text-align:center">Refractive index</th>        <th widht=25% style="text-align:center">Material</th>        <th widht=25% style="text-align:center">Refractive index</th>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Titanium Dioxide Anatase</td>        <td style="text-align:center">2.71</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Basic lead carbonate</td>        <td style="text-align:center">2.00</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Titanium Dioxide Rutile</td>        <td style="text-align:center">2.52</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Basic lead sulfate</td>        <td style="text-align:center">1.93</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Zinc sulfide</td>        <td style="text-align:center">2.37</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Barium sulfate </td>        <td style="text-align:center">1.64</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Zinc oxide</td>        <td style="text-align:center">2.02</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Talcum powder</td>        <td style="text-align:center">1.57</td>   </tr></table><h1 id="Part-3-The-important-role-of-titanium-dioxide-in-powder-coatings"><a href="#Part-3-The-important-role-of-titanium-dioxide-in-powder-coatings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The important role of titanium dioxide in powder coatings"></a>Part 3: The important role of titanium dioxide in powder coatings</h1><p>In the formulation design of powder coatings, the combination of resin and cross-linking agent is regarded as the direction that must be considered in the main performance of powder coating; therefore, the development of resin and cross-linking agent is devoted. But this does not mean that titanium dioxide is not so important, you can adjust and replace it.</p><p>Titanium dioxide has an impact on the production, coating and film properties of powder coatings. In the production process, the dispersion of titanium dioxide directly affects the mixing effect, and also affects the dispersion of hot melt and the level of productivity in the extrusion processing. During the heat curing of the coating film, the surface properties of the titanium dioxide also affect the fluidity of the hot melt, the hardening speed and the yellowing which occurs during excessive baking. In terms of coating film performance, titanium dioxide affects the hiding power, gloss and weather resistance of the coating film.</p><p>Therefore, when developing powder coatings, consider how to choose the right titanium dioxide. When using titanium dioxide, it is recommended to consider the following properties of titanium dioxide:</p><p><strong>(1) the type of titanium dioxide</strong><br><strong>(2) the surface treatment of titanium dioxide</strong><br><strong>(3) the particle size distribution of titanium dioxide</strong><br><strong>(4) the pH of titanium dioxide</strong><br><strong>(5) titanium dioxide Water content</strong></p><h2 id="Types-of-titanium-dioxide"><a href="#Types-of-titanium-dioxide" class="headerlink" title="Types of titanium dioxide"></a>Types of titanium dioxide</h2><p>Commercial titanium dioxide can be divided into two categories: anatase and rutile titanium dioxide. The crystal characteristics and physical constants of titanium dioxide are shown in Table 2. Due to the difference in chemical structure, although it belongs to titanium dioxide, its performance is different. The coating is made of anatase titanium dioxide, which is prone to chalking in daylight. Compared with rutile titanium dioxide, the powdering resistance is better. Therefore, in the selection of titanium dioxide category, it is recommended to use rutile titanium dioxide.</p><table>    <tr style="text-align:center">        Chart 2: Crystal properties and physical constants of titanium dioxide    </tr>   <tr>        <th width=40% style="text-align:center">Physical properties</th>        <th width=30% style="text-align:center">Titanium dioxide rutile</th>        <th widht=30% style="text-align:center">Titanium dioxide anatase</th>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Crystal system</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Tetragonal</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Tetragonal</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Crystal shape</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Needle shape</td>        <td style="text-align:center">Cone shape</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">d(μm)</td>        <td style="text-align:center">0.2-0.5</td>        <td style="text-align:center">0.1-0.5</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Relative density</td>        <td style="text-align:center">4.2-4.3</td>        <td style="text-align:center">3.8-3.9</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Refractive index</td>        <td style="text-align:center">2.71</td>        <td style="text-align:center">2.52</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Moh's hardness</td>        <td style="text-align:center">6-7</td>        <td style="text-align:center">5.5-6</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Melting point</td>        <td style="text-align:center">1858℃</td>        <td style="text-align:center">915℃ trun to rutile</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Cal/g.℃</td>        <td style="text-align:center">0.17</td>        <td style="text-align:center">0.17</td>   </tr>      <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">UV absorption rate(%)</td>        <td style="text-align:center">90</td>        <td style="text-align:center">67</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Hiding power</td>        <td style="text-align:center">30.1</td>        <td style="text-align:center">23.6</td>   </tr>   <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Tinting strength Reynolds</td>        <td style="text-align:center">1650</td>        <td style="text-align:center">1270</td>   </tr>     <tr>        <td style="text-align:center">Lattice constant</td>        <td style="text-align:center">a=0.459, c=0.296</td>        <td style="text-align:center">a=0.378, c=0.951</td>   </tr></table><h2 id="Surface-treatment-of-titanium-dioxide"><a href="#Surface-treatment-of-titanium-dioxide" class="headerlink" title="Surface treatment of titanium dioxide"></a>Surface treatment of titanium dioxide</h2><p>In order for titanium dioxide to perform its special functions under different powder coating systems, different surface coating treatments must be carried out in the production of titanium dioxide.  For example, in order to express dispersibility, gloss is treated with hydrated alumina (aluminum hydroxide); in order to enhance weather resistance, surface treatment of hydrated silica and hydrated zirconia is performed. In order to enhance the wetting effect and the fluidity of the production, an organic surface of a polyol, an amine or a silane or a silyl ether is used.The whiteness of titanium dioxide is determined by the content of titanium dioxide in titanium dioxide; the more the surface treatment agent, the lower the content of titanium dioxide in titanium dioxide, thus affecting the whiteness of titanium dioxide. Therefore, it is desirable to have a higher whiteness when the powder coating film is applied, and it is more suitable to use a titanium white powder having a lower surface treatment agent content.In addition to the resin and formulation design, the surface coating of titanium dioxide also plays a supporting role.The surface coating treatment of alumina contributes to the dispersion of titanium dioxide in the resin system, thereby enhancing the optical properties of the titanium dioxide in the resin system, such as gloss, hiding power and the like. The crystallinity of alumina itself also contributes to the improvement of gloss. To design a semi-gloss or flat coating, choose a titanium dioxide powder with a silica treatment on the surface.Commercially available titanium dioxide has a surface treatment of alumina and silica. According to the functionality of gloss, there are so-called high-gloss titanium dioxide, glossy titanium dioxide and flat-light titanium dioxide.There are two ways to surface coat the silicon oxide.One is a loose adsorption type; after treatment, the surface structure is loose, the powder has a large particle size, the effective surface area is increased, and the oil absorption is high. In terms of functional performance, due to its loose structure, avoiding excessive crowding and creating a spatial effect, it contributes to the improvement of dry film hiding power.The other is a surface treatment of precipitation type; this method is to coat the silicon oxide tightly around the periphery of the TiO 2 particles, like a colored sugar coating outside the chocolate candy.Because of its compact structure, the structure of active titanium ions on the surface of TiO 2 and the polymer of the external environment are reduced, so that it does not cause yellowing, fading or chalking.Therefore, titanium dioxide can be divided into outdoor high weathering titanium dioxide and indoor titanium dioxide according to the degree of weather resistance. The TEM image of titanium dioxide coating without application is shown in Fig. 1.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/08/09/MQKmyShUndfVaNk.jpg" alt="Fig.1: Titanium dioxide TEM image"></p><p>The characteristics of titanium dioxide can be distinguished from the treatment of surface coated oxides. However, the detailed surface coating chemical and structural properties must be discussed with relevant scientific and technical personnel to further understand how to select the appropriate titanium according to product design. White powder.</p><h3 id="Particle-size-distribution-of-titanium-dioxide"><a href="#Particle-size-distribution-of-titanium-dioxide" class="headerlink" title="Particle size distribution of titanium dioxide"></a>Particle size distribution of titanium dioxide</h3><p>The particle size of titanium dioxide determines the color tone of the film.Titanium dioxide is produced in order to produce optimum optical properties, often with particle sizes around 0.2 microns and particle size distributions from 0.15 to 0.3 microns.  The smaller the particle size of titanium dioxide, the greater the degree of deviation of blue light, so the coating film will show a “blue-white” hue; if the particle size is larger, the hue tends to “yellow white”.  Particle size and discoloration force are shown in Figure 2.However, sometimes the titanium dioxide powder is yellowed because the purification process is not ideal at the time of manufacture, and coloring impurities such as vanadium ions or iron ions remain in the titanium dioxide.Therefore, in the production of powder coatings, if a special hue is specified, it is recommended to pay attention to the particle size and distribution of titanium dioxide. In addition to the dispersion of titanium dioxide affects the coverage, the particle size of titanium dioxide also affects the hiding power, the trend is shown in Figure 3.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/08/09/4UsFzd5ECcSuLmQ.png" alt="Figure 2 Particle size and scattering force"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/08/09/JUYl5hCW1THj6V4.png" alt="Figure 3 Particle size and relative hiding force"></p><h2 id="The-pH-of-titanium-dioxide"><a href="#The-pH-of-titanium-dioxide" class="headerlink" title="The pH of titanium dioxide"></a>The pH of titanium dioxide</h2><p>The pH value of titanium dioxide generally has a significant effect on waterborne coatings; it affects the performance of system dispersants and tackifiers. Powder coatings must be considered depending on the free acid concentration or accelerator type of the resin selected.In the general acid-catalyzed process, the titanium powder with a high pH value neutralizes the catalyst, so that the hardening is incomplete and the hardness of the coating film is lowered.Titanium dioxide with a low pH value will accelerate the acid catalyzing effect, making the coating film harden too fast, which may easily cause surface defects of the coating film.  Generally used at pH 7-8 is more suitable.</p><h2 id="The-water-content-of-titanium-dioxide"><a href="#The-water-content-of-titanium-dioxide" class="headerlink" title="The water content of titanium dioxide"></a>The water content of titanium dioxide</h2><p>Titanium dioxide powder will absorb some of the moisture in the environment, resulting in an increase in water content.The increase of water content of titanium dioxide powder will cause poor dispersion, poor fluidity, bridging the conveying pipeline, and the surface of the coating film will easily cause wrinkles, pinholes, fisheye and other defects.The degree of adsorption of moisture by titanium dioxide is related to the concentration of the surface treatment agent. Generally, the titanium dioxide with high treatment content has a higher moisture absorption degree.Therefore, when storing materials, it is best to control the temperature and humidity of the environment. It is recommended that the warehouse temperature not exceed 27 ° C, the relative humidity does not exceed 75%, in order to avoid the risk of “powder dust explosion”, the facilities of the ventilation equipment can be strengthened to maintain air circulation and reduce indoor dust concentration.It is recommended that the water content of the powder (including titanium dioxide, filler and other powders) should not exceed 0.5%.</p><h1 id="Part-4-Method-for-evaluating-the-suitability-of-titanium-dioxide-in-powder-coatings"><a href="#Part-4-Method-for-evaluating-the-suitability-of-titanium-dioxide-in-powder-coatings" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Method for evaluating the suitability of titanium dioxide in powder coatings"></a>Part 4: Method for evaluating the suitability of titanium dioxide in powder coatings</h1><p>Titanium dioxide, like other raw materials, does not allow for all of the design requirements. It can be fully expressed in some characteristics, but it may have negative effects in other aspects, so the characteristics of the product must be considered when selecting titanium dioxide. In the evaluation of whether titanium dioxide is appropriate, it is often divided into three major properties to compare:</p><ol><li><strong>Powder properties include: fineness distribution of powder, powder fluidity, gelation activity.</strong></li><li><strong>The optical performance of the coating film includes: color, hiding power, gloss (20°, 60°), and degree of yellowing of excessive baking.</strong></li><li><strong>Mechanical properties of the coating include: hardness test, solvent resistance test, flexibility test, impact test.</strong></li></ol><h1 id="Part-5-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Conclusion"></a>Part 5: Conclusion</h1><p>Powder coating formulation design is often adjusted according to different needs.Resins, bridging agents, pigments, fillers and other additives are common in basic formulations. Titanium dioxide is also an important component in powder coatings. I hope that the narrative of this article can provide another perspective for research and development in the coating and titanium dioxide industries.  For the production of titanium dioxide, the development of new titanium dioxide products, the application of titanium dioxide products in powder coatings has reference significance.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong><br>[1] Jiang Wenqi.Progress in green coating research [J].2009，36(5)：68-69． Guangdong Chemical Industry, 2009, 36 (5): 68-69.<br>[2] Lin Ling, Zhou Bin.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the white pigment used to give whiteness and hiding power, also called opacity, to coatings, inks, and plastics. The reason for this is two-fold:</p><ul><li>TiO2 particles of the right size scatter visible light, having wavelength λ ≈ 380 - 700 nm, effectively because TiO2 has a high refractive index</li><li>It is white because it does not absorb visible light<br>The pigment is expensive, especially when volume prices of systems are used. Most paint and ink companies buy raw materials per weight and sell their products by volume. As TiO2 has a relatively high density, ρ ≈ 4 g/cm3, the raw material contributes substantially to the volume price of a system.</li></ul><p>Let’s learn more about this pigment starting with its scattering efficiency… </p><h1 id="Scattering-by-Solid-Particles"><a href="#Scattering-by-Solid-Particles" class="headerlink" title="Scattering by Solid Particles"></a>Scattering by Solid Particles</h1><p>The refractive index, represented by the letter n, of a material describes how light propagates through, and is bent by, that material. The magnitude of the refractive index, depending upon the electronic structure of the molecules, governs to what extent the path of light changes, when entering or leaving a material.</p><p>Particles in a matrix, like pigment particles surrounded by the binder system in a coating, ink or plastic, can change the propagation direction of light when the particles and the matrix have a different refractive index. This phenomenon, called scattering, results in both white color (provided that the particles do not absorb visible light) and hiding power of the system.</p><img src="/2019/08/05/Titanium-Dioxide-Optimization-Selection-Strategies/Scattering.jpg" class="" title="Scattering of Light by Particles in a Matrix"><h2 id="Scattering-Efficiency"><a href="#Scattering-Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Scattering Efficiency"></a>Scattering Efficiency</h2><p>The scattering efficiency of pigment particles in a system is governed by two key properties.</p><ul><li><p>Scattering is strong when the difference in refractive index of particle &amp; matrix, Δn = np - nm, is big<br>The refractive index of binders used in coatings and inks is around 1.55.

Particle loading is quantified by the property Pigment Volume Concentration (PVC). The PVC of a system is defined as the volume percentage of solid particles in the system after film formation has taken place:</p><blockquote><p>Vp: Total volume of all pigments in the system<br>Vf: Total volume of all fillers in the system<br>Vb: Volume of the non-volatile part of the binders in the system</p></blockquote><p>The definition implies that the PVC of a system is calculated by leaving the volatile components, like water and solvents, out. The volumes of the non-volatile components should be used, implying that weights must be transferred into volumes by using the density of each of the components.</p><p>A system of high PVC has a high loading of solid particles and a system of low PVC contains a low amount of solid particles, as shown in the figure below:</p>The TiO2 particles must be separated from each other and distributed uniformly over the system, in order to obtain optimum scattering of each primary titanium dioxide particle.<p>Pigment particles hinder each other with respect to scattering when the particles are close to one another. The PVC of a system, especially the PVC in TiO2, is important with respect to the scattering efficiency of TiO2 particles. The distance between titanium dioxide particles goes down when the PVC in TiO2 goes up.</p><p>At PVC in TiO2 of around 15%, the distance between the pigment particles becomes so small that particles start to interfere with each other. The scattering efficiency of each pigment particle becomes worse and worse when the PVC in titanium dioxide is increased between 15 and 30%. </p><p>When the PVC in TiO2 is higher than about 30 volume%, the particles interfere so strongly that scattering power goes down when more TiO2 particles are added. This implies that:</p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Adding titanium dioxide to paint in large quantity worsens both hiding power and<br>white color strength when raising the PVC in TiO2 above 30%!</strong><br>With respect to the composition of a system that contains titanium dioxide pigment that is meant to give whiteness and hiding power because of scattering, the PVC in TiO2 should not exceed the threshold value of 30 volume-%. The total PVC, taking all solid particles into account, of a system can be (much) higher than 30%, as long as the PVC in TiO2 is below 30%. </p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><h1 id="Ways-to-Optimize-the-Use-of-Titanium-Dioxide-for-Paint-Industry"><a href="#Ways-to-Optimize-the-Use-of-Titanium-Dioxide-for-Paint-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Optimize the Use of Titanium Dioxide for Paint Industry"></a>Ways to Optimize the Use of Titanium Dioxide for Paint Industry</h1><h2 id="Optimize-the-Dispersion-Process"><a href="#Optimize-the-Dispersion-Process" class="headerlink" title="Optimize the Dispersion Process"></a>Optimize the Dispersion Process</h2><p>Each primary TiO2 particle has to be used as efficiently as possible.

This has two implications:</p><ol><li>A lot of work must be done to separate the particles from each other during the dispersion process. Separation is done by using high-energy dispersion equipment like:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Disk disperser (often called dissolver), or<br>Pearl mill<br>The shear forces in a dissolver set-up are too weak to separate all primary pigment particles from one another. More complete separation is obtained by using a pearl mill.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><img src="/2019/08/05/Titanium-Dioxide-Optimization-Selection-Strategies/DipersionEquipement.jpg" class="" title="Dispersion Equipment used to separate Solid Particles from Each Other"></li><li>The particles must be stabilized against flocculation. That is, the spontaneous gluing together of solid particles in a liquid caused by the attractive forces between the particles. Stabilization against flocculation is obtained by adsorbing a stabilizer, called dispersant, at the surface of the solid particles immediately after particles have been separated from each other.<br>The dispersant assures that the particles repel each other. Thus, particles remain separated from each other. Two mechanisms can be used for this:</li></ol><ul><li>Electrostatic stabilization: It results when all particles have an identical electrostatic charge.</li><li>Steric stabilization: It results from polymeric tails, being part of the dispersant molecules, that dissolve in the liquid continuous phase surrounding the particles.<iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://coatings.specialchem.com/tutorial/dissolver-mill-grind-fineness-pigments-fillers?src=pcselectionguide" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></li></ul><h2 id="Distribute-the-Particles"><a href="#Distribute-the-Particles" class="headerlink" title="Distribute the Particles"></a>Distribute the Particles</h2><p>The scattering efficiency of expensive titanium dioxide pigment is maximized when all primary particles are separated from each other, stabilized against flocculation and distributed over the complete system. The distance between the individual pigment particles should be as large as possible. It is said that the pigment particles must be spaced in the system.</p><img src="/2019/08/05/Titanium-Dioxide-Optimization-Selection-Strategies/PreventingCrowding.jpg" class="" title="Spacing and crowding of TiO2"><p><strong>Spacing</strong> can be obtained when TiO2 particles are combined with filler particles that have a comparable size. The filler particles do not scatter light but they prevent interference of the titanium dioxide particles. <strong>Crowding</strong>, the undesired grouping together of TiO2 particles, results when the pigment is combined with filler particles that are big, compared to the TiO2 particles. </p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Optimum whiteness and hiding power of titanium dioxide pigment can be obtained by combining<br>the pigment with the right dosage of filler particles with the right size.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><h2 id="Pigment-Professionals-Stay-Alert"><a href="#Pigment-Professionals-Stay-Alert" class="headerlink" title="Pigment Professionals - Stay Alert!"></a>Pigment Professionals - Stay Alert!</h2><p>Reduce costs!

The individual chemical units of titanium dioxide, TiO2, can be stacked in several ways, giving different crystal structures. Mainly two crystal structures of titanium dioxide are used for pigments: <strong>anatase</strong> and <strong>rutile</strong>.</p><img src="/2019/08/05/Titanium-Dioxide-Optimization-Selection-Strategies/PropertiesofcommonTiO2Pigments.jpg" class="" title="Key Properties of the Main TiO2 Crystal Structures"><p>The two crystal structures have an identical chemical composition, but the spatial orientation of the TiO2 units in the crystal lattice differs. Because of this difference, the two materials differ slightly in properties like density, Moh hardness, and refractive index. </p><p>The density of titanium dioxide in paint depends on the type and amount of <strong>post-treatment</strong>. Anatase TiO2 has a lower hardness than rutile, implying that anatase particles are less abrasive and therefore give less wear of equipment. This is beneficial for some applications. Rutile titanium dioxide has the highest scattering efficiency because rutile TiO2 has a higher refractive index than anatase.</p><h1 id="Photo-Activity-of-TiO2"><a href="#Photo-Activity-of-TiO2" class="headerlink" title="Photo Activity of TiO2"></a>Photo Activity of TiO2</h1><p>Titanium dioxide particles hardly absorb visible light. However, TiO2 particles do absorb UV radiation, for example from sunlight. </p><p>Chemical reactions take place at the surface of a TiO2 particle when UV light is absorbed. It is said that titanium dioxide is photoactive. Radicals, chemical substances of high reactivity, are formed when UV radiation is absorbed in the surface of a titanium dioxide particle. The radicals can induce chemical reactions in which the polymers in the system are broken down. This phenomenon is highly undesirable, as it breaks the system down upon exposure to sunlight. Such a system is said to have a poor weathering resistance or that it has a poor outdoor durability.</p><h2 id="Post-treatment"><a href="#Post-treatment" class="headerlink" title="Post-treatment"></a>Post-treatment</h2><p>Photocatalytic degradation of a system containing titanium dioxide pigment is prevented by post-treating the pigment particles. By doing so, the photoactive TiO2 core of each pigment particle is shielded and photochemical breakdown of the binder system by radicals is prevented.</p><p>Alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2) and zirconia (ZrO2) are the main inorganic post-treatments used for titanium dioxide pigments. The amount and quality of post-treatment govern how suitable the pigment is to be used for systems, like coatings, inks, and plastics, that are exposed to sunlight. </p><p>Depending on the post-treatment, the surface of TiO2 particles can either be dense or porous. Next to inorganic post-treatment, a low percentage of organic material is used in the final steps of the production process of titanium dioxide pigment. The main objective of organic post-treatment, often consisting of alcohols, is to improve the dispersibility of the pigment. An effective organic post-treatment assures that it is easier to separate the primary particles from each other during the dispersion process. </p><h1 id="Production-of-TiO2-Pigment"><a href="#Production-of-TiO2-Pigment" class="headerlink" title="Production of TiO2 Pigment"></a>Production of TiO2 Pigment</h1><p>A few processes are used to produce TiO2 pigment.</p><ul><li>Rutile TiO2 is found in nature. This is because the rutile crystal structure is the thermodynamically stable form of titanium dioxide. In chemical processes natural TiO2 can be purified, thus obtaining synthetic TiO2.</li><li>TiO2 pigment can be made from ores, rich in titanium, that are mined from the earth. Two chemical routes are used to make both rutile and anatase TiO2 pigments. <blockquote><blockquote><p>In the sulfate process, the titanium-rich ore is reacted with sulfuric acid, giving TiOSO4. Pure TiO2 is obtained from TiOSO4 in several steps, going via TiO(OH)2. Depending on the chemistry and route chosen, either rutile or anatase titanium dioxide is made.<br>In the chloride process, crude titanium-rich starting material is purified by converting titanium to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) by using chlorine gas (Cl2). The titanium tetrachloride is then oxidized at high temperature, giving pure rutile titanium dioxide. Anatase TiO2 is not made via the chloride process.<br>In both processes, the size of the pigment particles as well as the post-treatment is adjusted by fine-tuning the final steps in the chemical route.</p></blockquote></blockquote></li></ul><h1 id="Selecting-the-Right-Type-of-Paint-Pigment-Titanium-Dioxide"><a href="#Selecting-the-Right-Type-of-Paint-Pigment-Titanium-Dioxide" class="headerlink" title="Selecting the Right Type of Paint Pigment Titanium Dioxide"></a>Selecting the Right Type of Paint Pigment Titanium Dioxide</h1><p>The properties and behavior of titanium dioxide, as discussed above, should be taken into consideration when a TiO2 pigment must be chosen. </p><ol><li>A pigment with the right crystal structure should be selected. Rutile TiO2 scatters visible light most efficiently because of the high refractive index: nrutile = 2.75.</li><li>The particles must have the right size. The average primary particle diameter, called d-50, should be around 280 nm for the optimum scattering of visible light.</li><li>The amount and composition of the inorganic post-treatment should be chosen correctly with respect to the application. The type and amount of post-treatment of the pigment govern the degree of photoactivity. For outdoor durable coatings, for example, rutile TiO2 grades with a high percentage of alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2) and/or zirconia (ZrO2) should be used.<br>These three selection criteria can be checked easily as, in general, crystal structure, average particle size and type and amount of inorganic post-treatment can be found in the technical documentation, as provided by the pigment producer. </li></ol><p>There are a few attention points that are less easy to check. The particle size distribution (PSD) of the pigment, for example, should be narrow with the maximum at d ≈ 280 nm. </p><p>Also, the pigment should contain a low amount of aggregates, primary particles glued or fused together so strongly that they will not be separated when using conventional dispersion equipment, like a dissolver or bead mill. The primary particles should be easy to separate. In technical documentation, this is often referred to as easy dispersible. Both the degree of aggregation and the dispersibility are governed by the production process of the titanium dioxide supplier. </p><p>Anatase TiO2 has the disadvantage of scattering visible light less efficiently than rutile TiO2. On the other hand, anatase particles have a lower Moh hardness than rutile particles, implying that anatase gives less abrasion of equipment.</p><p>Often titanium dioxide pigments made via the sulfate process tend to be a little bit more yellow than pigments made via the chloride process. In practice, this slight color difference is hardly visible in complete systems.</p><h1 id="TiO2-Nanoparticles"><a href="#TiO2-Nanoparticles" class="headerlink" title="TiO2 Nanoparticles"></a>TiO2 Nanoparticles</h1><p>In most systems, titanium dioxide in paint industry is used as a white pigment, giving high white color strength as well as hiding power, called opacity. </p> <p>TiO2 absorbs UV radiation effectively, especially when the pigment particles are small. Small particles have a high specific surface area and are therefore effective in absorbing radiation. Nano-sized post-treated titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) pigments, with rutile crystal structure and particle diameter of around 10 nm, are used as UV absorber in systems ranging from coatings to sun creams. A coating containing nano-TiO2 is transparent because the particles do hardly scatter visible light.</p><p>However, in most coatings UV protection is assured by using organic additives, like UV absorbers in combination with radical scavengers.</p><h1 id="Substitute-for-Titanium-Dioxide-in-Paint"><a href="#Substitute-for-Titanium-Dioxide-in-Paint" class="headerlink" title="Substitute for Titanium Dioxide in Paint"></a>Substitute for Titanium Dioxide in Paint</h1><p>Titanium dioxide in paint industry can be combined with other materials that scatter visible light to obtain extra scattering efficiency. A precondition for such a material is that it has a refractive index that differs substantially from the refractive index of the binder system surrounding the particles. Preferably, it is possible to distribute the material as particles with a diameter of around 300 nm in the system.</p><img src="/2019/08/05/Titanium-Dioxide-Optimization-Selection-Strategies/Airparticleinbindermatrix.jpg" class="" title="An Air Particle in a Binder Matrix"><p>It turns out that there is only one real practical option: the use of air, having a refractive index n = 1.00. Air particles in a system do not absorb visible light and they give both a white color as well as hiding power. Apart from that, stable air particles of the right size can act as effective spacers for the TiO2 particles.<br>Particle↔Matrix|Δn<br>–|–:<br>Rutile TiO2 ↔ Matrix|1.20<br>Air ↔ Matrix|0.55</p><p>Air particles do not scatter visible light as effectively as TiO2 particles, even when air is well distributed in the matrix as particles with the optimum diameter. The reason is that the difference in refractive index of TiO2 and binder matrix is bigger than the difference in refractive index of air and binder matrix. </p><p>There are several ways to introduce air particles in a coating.</p><ul><li>An approach that is often used is to load the system with such a high amount of solid particles that there is insufficient binder in the system to cover all the solid particles and to fill the spaces between the solid particles. Then, air voids form during film formation when water and/or solvent evaporates from the system.</li><li>Another option is to use fillers that have air bubbles encapsulated within the particles. Flash-calcined kaolin is a filler that was treated with heat in such a way that closed pores are formed in each solid particle.</li><li>An approach used to assure that stable air particles of the right size are introduced in the system is to use hollow polymeric filler. After film formation, the filler particles consist of an air core in a shell of polymer. The size of the whole particle, as well as the thickness of the shell of each particle, is such that the air within the particles gives optimal light scattering. Apart from this, hollow filler particles of the right size arrange spacing of the pigment particles.<img src="/2019/08/05/Titanium-Dioxide-Optimization-Selection-Strategies/HollowPolymericParticle.jpg" class="" title="Hollow Polymeric Particles in Binder Matrix"></li></ul><h1 id="Use-the-Concepts-in-Practice"><a href="#Use-the-Concepts-in-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Use the Concepts in Practice"></a>Use the Concepts in Practice</h1><p>Practice shows that often a lot of money can be saved when titanium dioxide pigment is used to give whiteness and hiding power to a coating, especially by:</p><ul><li>Improving the separation process, and/or</li><li>Changing the type or amount of dispersant<br>It is worth the effort to study your system and try to find out whether the primary TiO2 particles in your system are:</li><li>Separated from each other</li><li>Stabilized sufficiently against flocculation, and</li><li>Distributed well<br>A possible next step might be to study whether any options are available to introduce or improve spacing of the TiO2 particles in your system.</li></ul><p>Commercially Available Grades for Titanium Dioxide for Paints &amp; Coatings</p><p><strong>TINOX A-2380</strong>  <strong>TINOX</strong></p><p><strong>TINOX A-2380</strong>is a pure, dry-milled anatase universal pigment from the sulphate process.

During both, the production process at the TiO2 producer and the manufacturing process of paints, coatings and composite materials, avoiding the coagulation and agglomeration of the TiO2 dispersion is important. Surface chemistry of the TiO2 dispersion can be controlled during the measurement of Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude (ESA) by regulating the pH value e.g. for avoiding flocculation of dispersion. This means: the zeta potential of the dispersion should not be or close to zero. Zeta potential is a dimension of the effective surface charge of particles and the interaction between the particles with ions in solution and particles among each other. Characterising the absolute surface charge (in an aqueous dispersion) of the TiO2pigment, negative or positive in the unit [mV], gives a decisive parameter for an ultimate application of the product. The zeta potential depends on the kind of solvent, the nature and amount of the ions in solution (specific conductivity), and the pH value. It is also the main factor determining the stability of the whole dispersion.</p><img src="/2019/07/29/Research-on-TiO2-pigment-posttreatment-and-it%C2%B4s-influence-on-Electrostatic-Stability-of-technical-dispersion-at-TINOX-Chemie-GmbH/equipment.jpg" class="" title="The lab equipment of TINOX"><h2 id="Materials-measurement-technique-and-devices"><a href="#Materials-measurement-technique-and-devices" class="headerlink" title="Materials, measurement technique and devices"></a>Materials, measurement technique and devices</h2><p>The applied materials and measurement techniques are listed as follows.

Handling TiO2 dispersions in a range beyond the IEP avoids any kind of flocculation. Choosing pH values in an extreme area could be a disadvantage regarding both, the electrostatic property of the pigment surface and the ionic charge in the dispersion. With increasing ratio of Al2O3/SiO2 posttreatment of TiO2 base material the isoelectric point IEP shifts to alkaline pH. With increasing SiO2 posttreatment the positive surface charge decrease.</p><p>Experienced users and specialists know well that, for example, Al2O3 and SiO2 compounds have been used for decades in TiO2 posttreatment processes. However, improvements have been made repeatedly in the type of post-treatment. E.g. in the targeted control of shell texture (dense, continuous), structure (heterogeneous, homogeneous), layer thickness, et cetera.</p><p>The added value of current study lies in the method.

An oscillating voltage, generated by an AC source, is applied to a suspension, dispersion, or emulsion. Charged particles in dispersion vibrate with the frequency of an applied electric field. One or more frequencies can be applied. Sound waves are generated by the particle oscillation at these frequencies. The amplitude of these sound waves gives the Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude (ESA). The ESA signal is proportional to the dynamic mobility of the particle which in turn is proportional to the zeta potential of the particles in dispersion. For the use of this effect a certain density difference between the dispersion medium and the particle is required. For evaluable signals the density difference has to be at least 0.2 g/cm3. The measurements can be carried out with dispersions in aqueous- and alcoholic solutions and paste-like formulations.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-moog-088a47181/">Daniel Moog</a><br>27/04/2019<br><a href="http://www.tinoxchem.de/">TINOX CHEMIE GMBH</a><br>Düsseldorf, Germany</p>]]></content>
